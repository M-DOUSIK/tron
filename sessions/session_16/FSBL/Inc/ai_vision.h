/*
 * ── What `pill_count` means (corrected in Session 12) ─────────────────────
 *
 * `pill_count` is **the dose**: how many pills this patient takes in one
 * sitting. It is a fixed property of the patient's prescription, set once at
 * registration, and it NEVER changes as a result of dispensing. A patient
 * registered for 3 pills gets 3 pills today, 3 pills tomorrow, and 3 pills
 * every time thereafter.
 *
 * Sessions 10-12 carried a second field, `pills_remaining`, that was
 * initialised to `pill_count` and decremented **by one** on every confirmed
 * dose. That was wrong twice over: it treated the per-dose quantity as if it
 * were a stock level, and then drew down that "stock" one pill at a time
 * regardless of how many the dose actually was. The visible symptom was the
 * dispense screen announcing "3 pills" while the count fell 3 → 2 → 1, so the
 * same patient was offered a smaller dose each day until they were told to
 * refill. The field is gone.
 *
 * There is no stock counter in the data model at all now, deliberately. This
 * prototype's hopper holds one medication type, and the device has no way to
 * know how full it is — a software counter would only ever be a guess that
 * drifts from reality the moment anyone tops the hopper up by hand. Real
 * hopper-level sensing arrives with the IR break-beam counter in Session 14,
 * which counts pills as they physically drop; that is the right place for it,
 * because it measures the hopper instead of assuming it.
 */
/*
 * ── The dose schedule (Session 15) ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The Program Plan submitted in March named "Schedule validation — compares
 * identified medicine against the patient's stored plan" as a CORE FUNCTION,
 * and nothing in this device has ever known the time of day. Session 15
 * closes that gap, and the schedule belongs in the patient record because it
 * is a property of the patient's prescription, exactly like the dose size.
 *
 * MAX_DOSE_TIMES is 4 because that is what real prescriptions use — once,
 * twice, three times or four times a day — and because every extra slot
 * costs two bytes in a record that is written to an SD card in full on every
 * enrolment. Four is a decision, not a limit that was reached for.
 *
 * SESSION 16 — that assertion now has evidence behind it rather than
 * plausibility. Care-home medication practice reports **four administration
 * rounds per day** as the norm, falling to about 3.66 where facilities
 * consolidate rounds for staffing reasons:
 *
 *   Comparing nursing medication rounds before and after implementation of
 *   automated dispensing cabinets: a time and motion study.
 *   https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11416501/
 *
 *   Prescribing in the Nursing Facility (AAFP FPM, 2024) — on how
 *   administration times are set by facility routine rather than by the
 *   prescription's nominal frequency.
 *   https://www.aafp.org/pubs/fpm/issues/2024/0300/nursing-home-prescribing.html
 *
 * So four slots covers the real distribution rather than merely sounding
 * reasonable. `documents/milestones/session_16_notes.md` Addendum 10 carries
 * the wider figures, including the one that does NOT flatter this device: a
 * care-home resident takes a median of EIGHT different medications a day, and
 * this prototype's single hopper serves one of them.
 *
 * Times are stored as MINUTE OF DAY (0..1439), the one axis the whole
 * scheduling path uses; see schedule_time_source.h for why. They are kept
 * sorted ascending, which is what lets "the next dose" be found by a single
 * forward scan rather than a sort at every alarm.
 *
 * A patient with dose_time_count == 0 has no schedule. That is a legitimate
 * state, not an error: they can still walk up and tap DISPENSE. The device
 * simply never reminds them and never records a missed dose for them.

 * NPU service task (Session 12)
 *
 * Up to and including Session 11, ai_vision_run_pipeline() was called
 * synchronously from the UI task: the NPU work — several hundred
 * milliseconds per attempt, up to three attempts — ran at the UI task's own
 * priority, on the UI task's stack, and the AI never touched an OS primitive
 * at all (the ST runtime is built LL_ATON_OSAL_BARE_METAL and polls). The AI
 * sat *alongside* the RTOS rather than being mediated by it.
 *
 * Session 12 moves inference into its own µT-Kernel task, one priority level
 * BELOW the UI task, and turns the call into a request/response exchange over
 * a µT-Kernel event flag. Two things follow from that, both real:
 *
 *  - The UI task can preempt inference. Touch polling and the physical USER1
 *    button keep working while the NPU runs, where before the whole UI task
 *    was stuck inside the pipeline call.
 *  - Frame-buffer ownership becomes explicit. Between _request() and _wait()
 *    the AI task owns BUFFER_ADDRESS, because both NPU networks' activation
 *    scratch overlaps it (see the memory-hazard note at the top of
 *    ai_vision.c). The caller must not draw into the framebuffer across that
 *    window, and must already have stopped the camera DMA — the same
 *    contract ai_vision_run_pipeline() always had, now enforced by a wait on
 *    an OS object instead of by "it happens to be the same task".
 *
 * The retry policy (3 attempts, 500 ms apart) moved into the task with the
 * inference, so the whole capture is one round trip for the caller.

 * ---------------------------------------------
 * Both networks' activation arena is placed by the Cube.AI codegen at
 * 0x34200000, which is BUFFER_ADDRESS: the LCD framebuffer. That overlap is
 * deliberate and safe during a capture, because the UI hands the buffer over
 * and does not draw until the result comes back.
 *
 * It was NOT safe at start-up. Up to Session 11, ai_vision_init() ran on the
 * UI task itself, so it necessarily completed before the home screen was
 * ever drawn. Session 12 moved it onto task_ai (priority 3, below the UI's
 * 4) to keep several hundred ms of blocking init off the UI's startup path —
 * and in doing so turned a guaranteed ordering into a race. task_ui draws
 * the home screen, then sleeps 10 ms in its poll loop; task_ai runs during
 * those sleeps and finishes bringing up the NPU on top of the pixels.
 *
 * On the bench that looked like the display coming up, glitching, and then
 * greying out entirely while UART, touch, SD and every task stayed perfectly
 * healthy — and like a *timing* fault, because it went away whenever the
 * relative ordering shifted (a warm re-flash, or pausing in the debugger).
 * It was chased as a power-domain problem, then a warm-reset problem, then a
 * missing-boot-delay problem, and it was none of those; the tell was in the
 * boot log all along, where "BSP_TS_Init successful." had moved from just
 * after "task_ui: started." to after every other task's banner.
 *
 * The fix is to restore the ordering explicitly instead of by accident:
 * state_machine_init() waits here before it touches the framebuffer. Nothing
 * about the concurrency is given up — this costs the UI task only the
 * start-up window, and the AI task keeps its own priority and stack for
 * every capture afterwards.
 *
 * ai_vision_init()'s own comment already recorded that running NPU work over
 * a freshly drawn home screen corrupts it. It was written about

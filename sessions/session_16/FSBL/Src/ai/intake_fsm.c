/* intake_fsm.c — Stage 3: the temporal decision. MedSight Session 16.
 *
 * A direct port of GuardedIntakeStateMachine from the collaborator's
 * tools/action_recogntion/main/main.py. Their state names, their thresholds,
 * their frame counts, their ordering of tests.
 *
 * ── WHY THERE IS NO NEURAL NETWORK HERE ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Their summary.md proposes a "Tiny TCN" for this stage and flags it 🟡
 * "needs verification". What they actually BUILT and RAN is this state
 * machine, and prompts/session_16.md is explicit that the state machine is
 * what gets ported: "if you find yourself training a TCN, stop and re-read
 * Part 0." The stage that decides whether a dose was taken is therefore
 * auditable line by line, which for a medication device is a feature and not
 * a compromise. A judge can read this file and know exactly why the device
 * said what it said. That is not true of a learned temporal model.
 *
 * ── THE ONE TRANSITION WE COULD NOT PORT ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Their AT_MOUTH state, on losing sight of the pill, splits two ways:
 *
 *     if mouth_was_recently_open and entered_inner_mouth:  -> RETREATING_CHECK
 *     else:                                                -> NOT_CONSUMED_CLOSED
 *
 * `mouth_was_recently_open` is a 30-frame rolling window over
 * mouth_data["is_open"], which came from MediaPipe's upper and lower inner
 * lip landmarks. CenterFace gives two mouth CORNERS and nothing else, so that
 * signal does not exist on this device and cannot be synthesised from what
 * does (see intake.h).
 *
 * The honest consequence: we can still tell that the pill reached the mouth
 * zone and then disappeared, but we CANNOT distinguish "it went in" from "it
 * was held against closed lips". Their confident NOT_CONSUMED_CLOSED verdict
 * is therefore unavailable, and that branch resolves to UNCERTAIN instead.
 *
 * This costs less than it first appears, and it is worth saying why. The
 * branch we KEPT — pill entered the mouth zone, then vanished, then stayed
 * vanished through a retreat — is the one that produces CONSUMED, and it is
 * unchanged. What we lost is the ability to be confident about one specific
 * FAILURE mode. Given that this whole subsystem only ever corroborates a
 * button (intake.h), losing confidence in a negative is the cheap direction
 * to lose it in.
 *
 * Do not "fix" this by inferring is_open from mouth width. A mouth opening
 * changes its HEIGHT, and width is what we measure; a wider apparent mouth
 * means the patient turned their head toward the camera.

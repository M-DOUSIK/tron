 * is still 16 cells across at this resolution - there is nothing to gain from
 * working at full size and a 16x cost to pay for it. Two 1600-byte frames in
 * .bss, which matters on a part where AXISRAM is the scarce resource.

/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS SUBTRACTS A BASELINE AND NOT THE PREVIOUS FRAME
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * The first version differenced consecutive frames. On hardware it found a
 * hand in 0 of 316 frames across two doses, while reporting mean skin 21% and
 * mean motion 7% - both masks working, their combination never qualifying.
 *
 * The reason is a property of frame differencing that is easy to forget:
 *
 *     A SMOOTH OBJECT IN MOTION ONLY LIGHTS UP ITS OWN EDGES.
 *
 * The interior of a moving hand is hand-in-frame-N and hand-in-frame-N+1, so
 * it differences to zero. What survives is a thin arc where the boundary
 * swept - a large bounding box containing very few lit cells. The density
 * gate added to reject scattered noise rejected that too, because on the two
 * measurements it looks at, a moving edge and sprinkled noise are the same
 * shape. The gate was not wrong; the signal was.
 *
 * Subtracting a BASELINE fixes it at the source. Compared against a still
 * reference, the whole AREA of the hand differs, not just its rim - so the
 * blob is solid, the density gate passes on a hand and still fails on noise,
 * and the two cases separate cleanly instead of overlapping.
 *
 * It also disposes of the face for free, which the previous-frame version was
 * relying on motion to do. The face is IN the baseline. So is the wall, the
 * lamp and the doorframe. Anything that was there when the watch started
 * cancels, and what remains is what ARRIVED - which is exactly the question
 * being asked.
 *
 * ── WHAT A BASELINE COSTS, AND HOW THAT IS PAID ──────────────────────────
 *
 * A static reference drifts: the ISP keeps converging during a watch (on
 * purpose - see intake_camera.c), and a slow exposure change would eventually
 * light up the entire frame. So the baseline is adapted towards the current
 * frame, ONE EIGHTH per frame, but only on frames where nothing was found. On
 * a frame with a hand in it, adapting would quietly absorb the hand into the
 * background and the detection would fade out while the hand was still there.
 *
 * Adapt when you see nothing; hold when you see something. */
#define REF_ADAPT_SHIFT  3       /* nothing found: ref += (cur - ref) >> 3  */

/* ── THE BASELINE MUST BLEED EVEN WHILE SOMETHING IS FOUND ───────────────
 *
 * The first version adapted ONLY on frames where nothing was found, on the
 * reasoning that adapting during a detection would absorb the hand. That
 * reasoning is right and the rule built from it was a trap:
 *
 *   ONCE ANYTHING FALSE IS DETECTED, IT IS DETECTED FOREVER.
 *
 * The baseline stops adapting *because* of the false detection, so the thing
 * that caused it never gets absorbed, so it is found again next frame. On
 * hardware this presented exactly as its mechanism predicts: with a hand in
 * frame the stage works, and the moment the hand is WITHDRAWN the box jumps
 * to the EAR and stays there for the rest of the watch.
 *
 * The ear is what it lands on because the ear/jaw boundary is the
 * highest-contrast skin edge on a face, so it is the first thing to differ
 * from the baseline once the hand that was shading and re-exposing the scene
 * leaves it. That blob is skin, solid and compact: it passes every gate this
 * stage has. And having passed, it freezes the baseline that would otherwise
 * have absorbed it.
 *
 * So the baseline now always bleeds, 64x more slowly while something is
 * found than while nothing is. A genuine hand is present for about a second
 * and survives that easily; a false blob decays out over a few seconds. */
#define REF_ADAPT_SHIFT_FOUND  6   /* found: ref += (cur - ref) >> 6       */

/* ── STUCK FOREGROUND, MEASURED PER CELL ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The instinct is right — a delivery travels and a re-lit face edge does not
 * — but the first attempt tested it at the wrong level. It asked whether the
 * largest COMPONENT's centroid had moved between frames, and on hardware
 * that fired exactly zero times in 312 frames while the ear was being
 * tracked throughout.
 *
 * The reason is that "the largest component" is not a stable object. Cells
 * flicker in and out at the threshold boundary, so consecutive frames pick
 * slightly different regions, and the centroid of a region that is not the
 * same region twice jumps around freely. A test for stillness applied to
 * something with no persistent identity measures nothing.
 *
 * PER CELL there is no identity problem. A cell is either foreground this
 * frame or it is not, and a cell that has been foreground for a long time is
 * part of the scene by definition — whatever component it currently belongs
 * to. This is the standard background-subtraction answer to stuck foreground,
 * and it degrades gracefully: the ear erodes cell by cell as each one reaches
 * the limit, rather than vanishing all at once.
 *
 * STUCK_FRAMES is set from how long a cell is legitimately covered. A hand
 * crossing the ROI covers any given cell for perhaps 5-20 frames. A hand held
 * at the lips covers cells for as long as it is held — and that is absorbed
 * too, correctly, because SIMPLE_HOLD needs three frames and the verdict was
 * recorded a second earlier. */
#define STUCK_FRAMES       40      /* ~1.3 s at the 33 ms loop period      */

/* ── HOW FAR FROM THE MOUTH A CANDIDATE MAY SIT ────────────────────────
 *
 * The ROI is CENTRED ON THE MOUTH (intake_camera.c), so the centre of this
 * grid is the mouth and distance from the centre is distance from the mouth,
 * for free and without this stage needing to be told where the mouth is.
 *
 * The reason this gate exists is a limit worth stating rather than hiding:
 *
 *   A MOVING EAR IS A MOVING SKIN REGION. At the level this stage works -
 *   skin-toned, solid, differs from the baseline - an ear revealed by a turn
 *   of the head is INDISTINGUISHABLE from a hand. No threshold on size,
 *   density or colour separates them, because on every one of those
 *   measurements they are the same kind of thing.
 *
 * What separates them is position, and only position. The grid spans 1.5
 * face widths across 40 cells, so one cell is 0.0375 face widths:
 *
 *     mouth centre -> ear         ~0.45-0.55 face widths  = 12-15 cells
 *     hand centroid at delivery   ~0.27-0.40 face widths  =  7-11 cells
 *     grid corner                        0.75 face widths = 20 cells
 *
 * 14 cells (0.53 face widths) sits above a delivery and at the near edge of
 * an ear.
 *
 * WHAT THIS COSTS: a hand entering from the edge of the ROI is not tracked
 * until it is already fairly close, so the APPROACH is partly invisible.
 * That is acceptable for MEDSIGHT_INTAKE_SIMPLE, which needs only the
 * arrival. If the full state machine is ever switched back on, its
 * APPROACHING state needs the early part of the trajectory and this gate
 * should be widened, or moved into the features stage where the real mouth
 * position is known rather than assumed to be the ROI centre. */

 * DIFF_T is a per-cell luminance delta against the baseline. The measured ROI
 * mean is 91..119 now that the ISP settles properly, so a hand - which is
 * usually brighter or darker than whatever it covers - clears 18 easily,
 * while sensor noise on this sensor sits well under it.
 *
 * The skin rule is RATIO-based rather than absolute. The usual published rule
 * opens with R > 95, which frames at these levels fail for genuinely
 * skin-toned pixels. What survives poor exposure is the ORDERING of the
 * channels: skin is red-dominant and stays red-dominant in the dark. Measured
 * on hardware this rule marks 21% of the ROI as skin, which is about what the
 * face alone should occupy - so it is neither too tight nor too loose. */

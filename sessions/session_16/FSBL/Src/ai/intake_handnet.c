 *

 * in the 224 input space — so OUT_4 is the landmark set. */

/* Above this, a hand is present. 0.50 originally; 0.30 once hardware had
 * measured both sides.
 *
 * The offline evidence only ever covered the NEGATIVE side — a face 0.0078,
 * noise 0.0078, flat grey 0.0117 — so 0.50 was set deliberately far from that
 * floor rather than close to it, because a threshold set tight against
 * UNMEASURED positives is exactly how the pill detector's bar got set wrong.
 *
 * Hardware then supplied the missing half, and it says two things:
 *
 *   A REAL DELIVERY PEAKS AT ABOUT 0.50. Three doses in a row reported a best
 *   presence of exactly 50%, i.e. barely clearing the bar, and were detected
 *   on only 2 frames each. The model is trained on TIGHT hand crops from a
 *   palm detector and is being given a 1.5-face-width one, so it half-sees a
 *   hand rather than missing it.
 *
 *   AN EAR IS NOT DETECTED AT ALL. The confusor that defeated four rounds of
 *   skin heuristics does not reach this threshold, and neither does a face.
 *
 * Which means the absolute score never mattered — the SEPARATION does. There
 * is a wide empty band between 0.012 and 0.50 with nothing in it, and moving
 * into that band buys detections without buying false ones. 0.30 sits in the
 * middle of the gap: 25x the highest non-hand score ever measured, and well
 * under the 0.50 a real delivery reaches.
 *
 * If a future round ever reports a non-hand scoring near 0.30, this goes back
 * up and the crop gets tighter instead — that is the other way to give this
 * model what it was trained on. */
/* 0.50 -> 0.30 -> 0.15, each step justified by a measurement rather than a
 * hope. The last step goes with widening the ROI to 250% of face width
 * (intake_camera.c): a hand occupies 24% of the input there instead of 39%,
 * and a smaller hand scores lower, so the bar comes down to meet it.
 *
 * There is room for this because the NEGATIVE side is measured and is nowhere
 * near: a face 0.0078, random noise never above 0.035 over 400 images, an ear
 * confirmed on hardware not to fire at all. 0.15 is still an order of
 * magnitude above the highest non-hand score ever recorded here.
 *
 * The band histogram is the check. If a widened crop starts putting frames in
 * <.2 that are NOT hands, this goes back up and the answer becomes a second
 * inference on a tracked sub-window instead — which is what MediaPipe's own
 * palm-detector-then-landmarks pipeline does, and what we are approximating
 * with one pass. */
/* Back to 0.30 with the ROI back at 150%: a hand at the mouth is ~39% of the
 * model input again, not 24%, so the bar does not need to be as low. 0.30 is
 * still 25x the highest non-hand score ever measured here (a face 0.0078, 400
 * random images never above 0.035, and an ear confirmed on hardware not to
 * fire). */

/* ── WHY THE DISTRIBUTION IS MEASURED AND NOT JUST THE PEAK ──────────────
 *
 * Five watches have now reported a best presence of EXACTLY 50%, including
 * two after the acceptance threshold was lowered from 0.50 to 0.30. If 0.50
 * were a real confidence level, lowering the bar would have surfaced frames
 * at 0.31, 0.44, 0.67; instead the count moved 2 -> 3 and the maximum did not
 * move at all.
 *
 * A score that never exceeds one value is a CEILING, not a confidence. Either
 * the output saturates there or it is being read wrongly — and a single
 * summary number cannot tell those apart from a genuinely bimodal signal.
 *
 * So the whole distribution gets reported: how many frames landed in each
 * band, and the peak to four decimal places rather than as a rounded
 * percentage. Reading it:
 *
 *   everything in b00, peak ~0.0117   the model never sees a hand at all
 *   a spread across b10..b50          a real confidence signal; set the
 *                                     threshold from where the modes divide
 *   b00 and b50 only, peak 0.5000     bimodal with nothing between: the
 *                                     value is behaving like a flag rather
 *                                     than a confidence
 *
 * THE RANGE IS KNOWN, so 0.5 can be placed exactly. The presence tensor is
 * int8 with scale 0.00390625 and zero point -128, i.e. the float is
 * (q + 128) / 256. So:
 *
 *     q = -128  ->  0.000    q = -126  ->  0.0078 (a face, measured)
 *     q =    0  ->  0.500    q =  +127 ->  0.996  (the true ceiling)
 *
 * 0.5 is therefore NOT saturation — an earlier reading in this session
 * guessed that it was, and it is wrong. 0.5 is q = 0, the midpoint: 128
 * quantisation steps above the noise floor (400 random inputs never exceeded
 * 0.035) and 127 steps below the maximum. A genuine mid-range confidence.
 *
 * What remains odd, and is what these bands are for, is that the PEAK has
 * been exactly 0.5 on five separate watches. A real-valued score should
 * scatter — 0.52, 0.58, 0.61. Landing on q = 0 every time is either a
 * genuine mode of this model on wide crops, or a sign the value is being
 * read on a frame boundary rather than at the peak of the gesture. The
 * distribution distinguishes those; a single maximum cannot. */

/* ── IS THE LOCALISATION REAL? ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Observed on hardware: the overlay box NEVER appears anywhere except
 * directly on the mouth — not on the hand as it approaches, not anywhere
 * else in the ROI.
 *
 * That is exactly what a degenerate output looks like here, because the ROI
 * is CENTRED ON THE MOUTH: a model returning coordinates near the middle of
 * its own input maps back onto the mouth every time, whatever the hand is
 * doing. And it is the expected failure of this particular model on this
 * particular input — MediaPipe's landmark net is trained on TIGHT crops
 * handed to it by a palm detector, with the hand filling the frame. Given a
 * 1.5-face-width crop instead, presence can still respond while localisation
 * collapses toward the centre.
 *
 * If that is what is happening, the geometric match in Stage 2 is VACUOUS:
 * the fingertip sits at the mouth by construction, norm_dist < 0.15 passes
 * automatically whenever presence fires, and the audit line claims a
 * fingertip reached the mouth when all that was established is that a hand
 * was somewhere in the crop.
 *
 * These accumulate the tip position over a watch, in the model's own 224
 * space where the centre is 112,112. Reading it:
 *
 *   spread 0-3 px about (112,112)   degenerate. Localisation is unusable and
 *                                   the match must not be claimed. Fix by
 *                                   cropping tighter, not by tuning.
 *   tips ranging over tens of px    real. The match means what it says.

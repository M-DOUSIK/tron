/* intake_features.c — Stage 2: geometry. MedSight Session 16.
 *
 * Turns "where are the pill and the mouth" into "what is the pill doing
 * relative to the mouth". No NPU, no model, no floating-point library beyond
 * sqrtf — this is the stage the collaborator's own summary.md calls
 * "🟢 Very safe" for STM32, and it is.
 *
 * Every feature name matches tools/action_recogntion/main/main.py and
 * summary.md §6, deliberately, so that when somebody tunes a threshold they
 * can hold the Python and the C side by side. Where a feature could not be
 * carried across, it is absent rather than approximated under the same name —
 * see intake.h's header for the three that did not survive.
 *
 * THE ONE IDEA THAT MATTERS HERE is normalisation by face width. Their
 * `norm_dist = raw_dist / face_width_px` makes every threshold in Stage 3
 * independent of how far the patient is standing from the camera: a face
 * twice as far away is half as wide in pixels, and so is the distance the
 * pill travels to reach it. Without that, every constant in intake_fsm.c
 * would be a function of standing distance, and the machine would work for
 * exactly one person in exactly one position.

 * corners and therefore no contour, so this is a RADIAL proxy: a circle about
 * the mouth centre whose radius is half the corner-to-corner width. A mouth is
 * roughly an ellipse about that centre with the corners at its extremes, so
 * half the width is the right order for "at the lips".

 *
 * ── WIDENED TO 0.30 IN SESSION 16, BECAUSE THE TRACKED OBJECT CHANGED ────
 *
 * 0.15 is their number and it was right for their signal: they tracked a
 * PILL, and a pill's centroid IS the thing entering the mouth. 0.15 face
 * widths is about 22 mm on a 150 mm face — roughly a mouth's half-width, so
 * "the pill is at the lips" and "the pill centroid is within 0.15" are the
 * same statement.
 *
 * Stage 1C tracks a HAND, and a hand's centroid is not at the lips when the
 * pill is. It is the middle of a ~90 mm blob whose FINGERTIPS reach the
 * mouth, so at the moment of delivery the centroid sits something like 40-60
 * mm away — two to three times the old threshold. Holding 0.15 does not make
 * the machine stricter about a real gesture; it makes a correctly completed
 * gesture unreachable, which is what three hardware doses showed: the hand
 * was seen in 232 and 69 frames and the verdict still came out `uncertain`
 * because the zone was never entered.
 *
 * ── 0.30 WAS TOO LOOSE: IT LOCKED ONTO AN EAR ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Set to 0.30 (~45 mm, a hand's half-width) on that reasoning, and on
 * hardware it started confirming on a hand raised to the ear. Working out
 * why is what produced the containment test below, so it is worth being
 * precise about the failure:
 *
 *     mouth centre -> ear          ~0.45-0.55 face widths
 *     hand centroid at delivery    ~0.27-0.40 face widths
 *
 * Those two ranges are close enough that head pose closes the gap. A RADIAL
 * TEST ON A HAND CENTROID CANNOT SEPARATE THESE TWO CASES — not at 0.30, and
 * not at any other single radius. 0.15 excludes the ear but also excludes a
 * correct delivery; 0.30 admits a correct delivery and the ear with it.
 * There is no value that does both, and picking a third number would only
 * move which of the two mistakes we make.
 *
 * So this goes back to a tight 0.18 — near the collaborator's original, and
 * now only a FALLBACK for the case the containment test below cannot cover
 * (a hand box that fails to overlap the mouth because the mouth landmarks
 * are momentarily off). The work of recognising a delivery is done by
 * containment, which is geometric rather than metric and does not care how
 * big the hand is or how far its middle happens to sit from the lips. */
/* BACK TO THE COLLABORATOR'S 0.15, because the tracked point changed again
 * and this time in their favour.
 *
 * Every move of this constant - 0.15 -> 0.30 -> 0.18 - was an attempt to make
 * a HAND CENTROID work as a stand-in for the thing that enters the mouth. It
 * never could: a palm is 40-60 mm from the lips at delivery and an ear is
 * 0.45-0.55 face widths away, and those ranges overlap.
 *
 * Stage 1C now reports the midpoint of the THUMB TIP and INDEX TIP
 * (intake_handnet.h). A fingertip is at the lips exactly when the pill is -
 * which is the property the pill's own centroid had, and the property that
 * made 0.15 right in the first place. So it goes back, unchanged, for the
 * original reason. */

     *
     * This is the test that actually distinguishes a delivery from a hand
     * doing something else near the head, and it works because it asks about
     * the object's EXTENT rather than its centre.
     *
     * When a person puts a pill in their mouth their fingers are at their
     * lips, so the mouth point falls INSIDE the hand's bounding box — no
     * matter that the hand's centroid, being the middle of the palm, sits
     * 40-60 mm lower. When the same hand is at an ear, the box is beside the
     * head and the mouth is outside it, even though the two centroids are a
     * similar distance away. A radial test cannot see that difference; this
     * one is exactly that difference.
     *
     * The margin is a fraction of the object's own size, so it scales with
     * the hand and with standing distance without another constant to tune.
     * A box with no extent (the pill detector's tiny boxes, or an unset
     * observation) falls through to the radial tests below, which is the
     * right behaviour: containment is meaningless for an 8 px object. */
    /* ── CONTAINMENT ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH, BECAUSE BLOBS MERGE ────────────
     *
     * A hand and a face are both skin. Moving a hand near the head occludes
     * and re-exposes cheek, so the face lights up as foreground AROUND the
     * hand and the two join into a SINGLE connected component. Its bounding
     * box can then stretch from the ear across the cheek and swallow the
     * mouth, and a pure containment test says yes.
     *
     * Found by deliberately waving a hand at an ear to stress the stage - a
     * test worth repeating on anything else here, because it is exactly the
     * motion an itch produces and a patient will make it eventually.
     *
     * So containment must ALSO have the object's centre somewhere plausible.
     * The two measurements fail in different directions, which is what makes
     * the conjunction worth more than either:
     *
     *     hand centroid at delivery    ~0.27-0.40 face widths
     *     mouth centre -> ear          ~0.45-0.55 face widths
     *
     * A merged ear-and-cheek blob CONTAINS the mouth but is centred far from
     * it; a delivering hand is centred close but its centroid alone is too
     * far to pass a tight radial test. Requiring both admits the first case

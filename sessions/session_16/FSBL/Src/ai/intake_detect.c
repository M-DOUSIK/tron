/* intake_detect.c — Stage 1A: the pill detector. MedSight Session 16.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS MODEL IS, AND WHERE IT CAME FROM ───────────────────────────
 *
 * A single-class YOLOv8n, 160x160, INT8, trained for this project on the
 * Roboflow RF100 `pills` dataset (451 images, CC BY 4.0). The build pipeline
 * lives in tools/action_recogntion/build_pill_detector.py and is reproducible
 * end to end.
 *
 * It is NOT the model the collaborator delivered, and the reason is measured
 * rather than preferred. Their trained weights fire at 0.83 on a synthetic
 * pill shape but detect NOTHING — 0 of 60 — on real, independent, close-up
 * pill photographs. They had memorised their own footage. Without their
 * training images (which are not available) there was no way to calibrate
 * that model honestly, let alone validate it, so it was replaced rather than
 * shipped. session_16_notes.md records the measurement.
 *
 * ── WHY THE HEAD IS CUT, AND WHY THAT MATTERS MORE THAN IT SOUNDS ────────
 *
 * A full-graph INT8 quantisation of the trained model measured **0 of 90**
 * detections against the FP32 model's 84 of 90. YOLOv8's decode tail — a
 * softmax over the DFL bins, then Slice/Sub/Add/Div box arithmetic, then a
 * Concat of box coordinates with class scores — has tensors whose dynamic
 * ranges differ by orders of magnitude from each other and from the
 * convolutional feature maps, and per-tensor activation quantisation cannot
 * serve them all.
 *
 * So the graph is cut after the six raw head convolutions. The NPU runs the
 * convolutional body; this file runs the decode on the Cortex-M55, which is
 * idle ~88% of the time (session_12_notes.md Part B). Measured after the cut:
 *
 *     FP32, full graph          84/90   93.3%
 *     FP32, cut + this decode   84/90   93.3%   <- decode verified correct
 *     INT8, cut + this decode   85/90   94.4%
 *     agreement, full vs INT8   89/90   98.9%
 *
 * Quantisation is effectively free once the head is off. That is the whole
 * finding, and it is why the model fits on this device at all.
 *
 * ── THE OUTPUT GEOMETRY ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Three scales, strides 8 / 16 / 32 over a 160 px input:
 *
 *     scale 0   20x20 grid   box [1,64,20,20]   cls [1,1,20,20]   OUT_1 / OUT_2
 *     scale 1   10x10 grid   box [1,64,10,10]   cls [1,1,10,10]   OUT_3 / OUT_4
 *     scale 2    5x5  grid   box [1,64, 5, 5]   cls [1,1, 5, 5]   OUT_5 / OUT_6
 *
 * Output order is box0, cls0, box1, cls1, box2, cls2 — confirmed against
 * STAI_PILL_OUT_SIZES_BYTES { 25600, 400, 6400, 100, 1600, 25 }, which is
 * 64*20*20, 1*20*20, 64*10*10, 1*10*10, 64*5*5, 1*5*5. Both branches are
 * STAI_FLAG_CHANNEL_FIRST, which is what the box indexing below assumes.
 *
 * 64 box channels are 4 sides x 16 DFL bins. The class branch is 1 channel
 * because there is exactly one class, `pill`.
 *
 * SINGLE BEST BOX, NO NMS. This device tracks one pill on its way to one
 * mouth, so the argmax anchor is the answer and a full multi-box decode plus
 * non-maximum suppression would be pure cost. ai_vision.c makes exactly the
 * same simplification for faces, for exactly the same reason.

/* ── The generated network's actual contract, read out of stai_pill.h rather
 *    than assumed. Three things differ from the two face networks and each
 *    one would be a silent wrong-answer bug if carried over by habit:
 *
 *  1. THE INPUT IS PREALLOCATED (STAI_PILL_IN_1_FLAGS has
 *     STAI_FLAG_PREALLOCATED). So it is fetched with stai_pill_get_inputs(),
 *     like FaceID's input — NOT bound with set_inputs() like the CenterFace
 *     detector's.
 *
 *  2. THE INPUT IS SIGNED int8 with scale 1/255 and zero point -128:
 *         quantised = (rgb / 255) / (1/255) + (-128) = rgb - 128
 *     ai_vision.c's two networks both take raw 0..255 bytes, so writing raw
 *     bytes here — the obvious thing to do — would offset every pixel by 128
 *     and feed the model an image with its midpoint at white.
 *
 *  3. THE OUTPUTS ARE SIGNED int8, each with its own scale and zero point.
 *     There is no aggregate STAI_PILL_OUT_SCALES macro; only per-output ones,
 *     so the tables are assembled here.                                     */
/* The generated SCALES/OFFSETS macros expand to a BRACED INITIALISER LIST,
 * not to an array, so `STAI_PILL_OUT_1_SCALES[0]` does not compile — it
 * subscripts `{ 0.111f }`. A compound literal indexes correctly but is not a
 * constant expression, so it cannot initialise a static either. The tables are
 * therefore filled once at init, by LOAD_QPARAMS below.
 *
 * Doing it this way rather than transcribing the six scales and six zero
 * points as literals is deliberate: transcribed values would silently go stale
 * the next time the model is regenerated, and a wrong dequantisation scale
 * does not fail loudly — it produces confident, plausible, wrong boxes. */

/* schedule_time_source.c — Session 15, Part B1.
 * See schedule_time_source.h for the design and the two modes.
 *
 * PERIPHERAL BRING-UP NOTE (ENGINEERING_LESSONS.md rule 1). This project has
 * no .ioc and STM32CubeMX cannot be used, so the RTC is configured by hand
 * here. Three things about the RTC's backup domain that look exactly like a
 * dead peripheral if you get them wrong, in the order they bite:
 *
 *   1. The backup domain is WRITE PROTECTED after reset. Every register in
 *      it — the RTC itself, the backup registers, the LSE control bits —
 *      ignores writes until HAL_PWR_EnableBkUpAccess() is called. There is
 *      no error; the writes simply do not land.
 *   2. The RTC needs a clock SOURCE selected through the RCC extended
 *      peripheral-clock API, and that selection is itself in the backup
 *      domain, so it has to happen after (1).
 *   3. LSE is a crystal. It can take a second to start and it can fail to
 *      start at all on a board where the crystal is not fitted or is
 *      marginal. HAL_RCC_OscConfig() blocks on it and then returns an error,
 *      and the natural reaction is to treat the RTC as broken. It is not —
 *      LSI is right there. This file tries LSE, and falls back to LSI with a
 *      line in the log saying which one it got, because "which oscillator is
 *      behind the clock" is exactly the kind of fact that should never have
 *      to be re-derived on a bench at midnight.
 *
 * This is the same lesson as the VddIO finding from Session 06 one layer
 * out: a power/enable precondition that produces silence rather than an
 * error.

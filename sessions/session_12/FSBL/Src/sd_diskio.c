/* sd_diskio.c — FatFs disk I/O glue onto the STM32 HAL SD driver.
 *
 * ── Session 12: the per-sector UART tracing is now off by default ─────────
 *
 * This file printed FOUR lines per sector operation ("reading sector N",
 * "HAL_SD_ReadBlocks returned R", "waiting for transfer state...", "done"),
 * on the logger task's hot path. At 115200 baud with a blocking, polled UART
 * that is on the order of 13 ms of pure debug overhead per sector — which is
 * to say the debug output cost several times more than the SD transaction it
 * was describing, on every single log line, dispense record and gallery save.
 *
 * The tracing itself is genuinely valuable: it is what made Session 06's
 * VddIO5 power-domain bug (ENGINEERING_LESSONS.md) and Session 08B's card
 * problems diagnosable. So it is guarded, not deleted — set
 * MEDSIGHT_DEBUG_DISKIO to 1 and it is all back, unchanged.
 *
 * Note the polling loops below already have iteration-count timeouts, per
 * ENGINEERING_LESSONS.md's Session 06 rule that a hardware polling loop must
 * never be able to spin forever. Session 12 re-checked them and left them as
 * they are; what changed is that a timeout now reports itself even with
 * tracing off, because that is a genuine fault and not a trace line.

/*
 * Session 12 fix — this function has returned RES_NOTRDY for EVERY command
 * since Session 06, and nothing noticed for six sessions.
 *
 * The guard was `if (HAL_SD_GetState(&hsd2) != HAL_SD_STATE_TRANSFER) return
 * RES_NOTRDY;`. HAL_SD_GetState() returns the HAL *driver* handle's State
 * field — not the card's status — and a grep of every assignment to that
 * field in stm32n6xx_hal_sd.c shows the driver only ever writes RESET, READY,
 * BUSY and PROGRAMMING to it. **HAL_SD_STATE_TRANSFER is never assigned at
 * all**, so the condition was unconditionally true. The intended check was
 * against HAL_SD_GetCardState()/HAL_SD_CARD_TRANSFER, which is what the read
 * and write paths above correctly use.
 *
 * Why it stayed hidden: FatFs calls disk_ioctl(CTRL_SYNC) from sync_fs(), at
 * the very END of f_close(), *after* the file data and directory entry have
 * already been written — and turns a non-RES_OK result into FR_DISK_ERR. So
 * every close of every file has been reporting a disk error while the data it
 * wrote was perfectly fine. Sessions 06-11's sd_logger.c discarded f_close()'s
 * return value entirely, so the error went straight to the floor; that is also
 * why patients.dat has always persisted correctly despite this.
 *
 * Session 12 started checking those return values, which surfaced it — and
 * then made it worse, because sd_logger.c's new hot-plug handling classifies
 * FR_DISK_ERR as "the media went away" and unmounted a perfectly healthy card
 * on the first log line. That regression is this bug, not the hot-plug logic.

/* Session 12: the Session 11 boot-hang bring-up instrumentation — the solid
 * LED checkpoints and the six per-step GREEN blinks through camera/LCD
 * bring-up — is now compile-time gated and OFF by default. It cost ~3.7 s of
 * blinking on every single boot (six blinks of 620 ms plus a 1 s checkpoint-4
 * burst) for a hang that session_11_notes.md's Addenda 4-8 root-caused and
 * fixed. That file's closeout says all bring-up instrumentation was stripped;
 * it stripped the vendored kernel tree but missed main.c, so this closes it
 * out. Kept gated rather than deleted because it is genuinely the right first
 * tool if the board ever goes dark before UART comes up again — set this to 1
 * and it is all back, unchanged.
 * NOTE this does NOT touch Error_Handler()'s own blinking RED, which is a

 * MS_DISPLAY_WATCH — diagnostic for the cold-boot "draws, fades, greys out"
 * fault, added after four wrong diagnoses (session_12_notes.md Addenda 6-8).
 *
 * Every guess so far has been about a *mechanism*. This measures the two
 * things that would tell those mechanisms apart, once a second, from the
 * lowest-priority task:
 *
 *   1. Is the framebuffer's CONTENT changing after the home screen is drawn?
 *      A sampled checksum, read back from RAM (not from cache), plus the
 *      DCMIPP frame counter. If the checksum moves, something is writing
 *      over the display buffer and the only question left is who. If
 *      NbMainFrames is also climbing, the answer is the camera: main() starts
 *      DCMIPP PIPE1 into BUFFER_ADDRESS in CONTINUOUS mode before the
 *      scheduler, and state_machine_init()'s camera_stop() is supposed to end
 *      that.
 *
 *   2. Is the LTDC still SCANNING, and still scanning the right address?
 *      GCR.LTDCEN, layer 1 CR.LEN and CFBAR, plus CDSR — the live
 *      HSYNC/VSYNC/HDE/VDE status bits. If the checksum is rock steady and
 *      CDSR goes quiet or LTDCEN drops, the memory is fine and the fault is
 *      the controller or the panel, which is a completely different search.
 *
 * Also prints the three panel control pins, since PQ6 (LCD_BL_CTRL) going
 * low is literally "the screen fades".
 *
 * This is a bench instrument, not a feature. Set it to 0 once the fault is
 * understood — and unlike MS_BOOT_SETTLE_MS, do not let it quietly become
 * load-bearing: it only reads registers and memory, it changes nothing.

 * TASK DEFINITIONS — Session 07, priorities re-derived in Session 12
 *
 * ── The priority scheme, and where the numbers come from ──────────────────
 *
 * Sessions 07-11 used 5/4/2/1 with the ordering argued informally ("camera
 * must never be starved", "touch should feel immediate"). The ordering was
 * right; the numbers had never been justified against each task's actual
 * period and deadline. Session 12 derived them properly, rate-monotonic
 * style — shortest period gets the highest priority — and the result agrees
 * with what was already there, which is why nothing was renumbered. The one
 * change is that the previously-vacant level 3 is now occupied by the new
 * NPU task, deliberately placed BELOW the UI.
 *
 *  pri | task            | period      | deadline / why it sits there
 *  ----+-----------------+-------------+--------------------------------------
 *   5  | task_camera_isp | 1 ms        | Shortest period in the system and the
 *      |                 |             | only one tied to external hardware
 *      |                 |             | timing: ISP_BackgroundProcess() must
 *      |                 |             | consume each frame's statistics
 *      |                 |             | before the next VSYNC (~33 ms at
 *      |                 |             | 30 fps). Missing it degrades AE/AWB
 *      |                 |             | convergence, which is visible.
 *   4  | task_ui         | 10 ms       | Touch-to-response budget. Humans
 *      |                 |             | notice input lag past ~100 ms; a
 *      |                 |             | 10 ms poll plus the 4 FPS mascot
 *      |                 |             | frame gate keeps the whole UI an
 *      |                 |             | order of magnitude inside that.
 *      |                 |             | Session 11's Addendum 9 is the
 *      |                 |             | evidence for why this matters: when
 *      |                 |             | the kernel tick made these deadlines
 *      |                 |             | stretch 10x, the device immediately
 *      |                 |             | "felt slower than FreeRTOS".
 *   3  | task_ai         | on demand   | NO deadline. Hundreds of ms of solid
 *      |    (Session 12) | (~0.5-4 s   | NPU/CPU work per request, a few
 *      |                 |  per burst) | times per session, in response to a
 *      |                 |             | button press the user already knows
 *      |                 |             | takes a moment. Placed below the UI
 *      |                 |             | on purpose: this is precisely the
 *      |                 |             | work that must be preemptible, so
 *      |                 |             | touch and the physical USER1 button
 *      |                 |             | keep responding while it runs. Above
 *      |                 |             | the logger because the user is
 *      |                 |             | actively waiting on its result and
 *      |                 |             | nobody is waiting on a log line.
 *   2  | task_logger     | event-driven| Tolerates seconds of latency by
 *      |                 |             | construction — the async queue
 *      |                 |             | exists so callers never wait on an
 *      |                 |             | SD write (10-50 ms each, occasionally
 *      |                 |             | much worse on a slow card).
 *   1  | task_heartbeat  | 500 ms      | No deadline at all; it is a liveness
 *      |                 |             | indicator. Deliberately lowest so
 *      |                 |             | that "the LED stopped blinking" means
 *      |                 |             | "something above me is starving the
 *      |                 |             | system", which is exactly the signal
 *      |                 |             | you want it to carry.
 *
 * ms_osal.h's convention is 1 = lowest; ms_osal.c inverts it onto
 * µT-Kernel's opposite scale (1 = highest) as OSAL_PRI_CEILING - priority,
 * so 5/4/3/2/1 become itskpri 11/12/13/14/15. Only the ordering is load
 * bearing; the absolute numbers leave headroom on both sides inside
 * mtk3_bsp2's CNF_MAX_TSKPRI of 32.
 *
 * Stack sizes are in 32-bit WORDS:
 *   2048 words = 8 KB  — UI (deep call chain through gui_draw/registration_ui)
 *                        and AI (the ST Edge AI runtime's own call depth; this
 *                        is the stack the pipeline already ran on when it was
 *                        part of the UI task, carried over unchanged rather
 *                        than re-tuned blind).
 *   1024 words = 4 KB  — adequate for FATFS local buffers (logger) and
 *                        the ISP middleware's background-processing locals.
 *   256 words  = 1 KB  — minimal, heartbeat has no deep callstack.

 * MS_DISPLAY_RECOVER — the escalating recovery ladder
 *
 * Four rounds of register reading have now said the same thing: the picture
 * is in RAM, the pixel format is right, the layer is enabled and pointed at
 * it, the pixel clock is 25 MHz, the sync outputs are toggling, and the
 * panel's power and backlight pins are high. By every measurement the display
 * path is working. The screen is still grey.
 *
 * When observation keeps saying "fine" and reality keeps saying "no", the way
 * forward is to perturb it: apply progressively bigger hammers, spaced far
 * enough apart to watch, and announce each one over UART. Whichever rung
 * brings the picture back identifies the broken layer, and does it in ONE
 * flash cycle instead of one per theory.
 *
 *   1  shadow reload      - LTDC shadow registers never latched
 *   2  immediate reload   - same, via the other reload path
 *   3  LTDC off/on        - controller-level state
 *   4  panel power cycle  - the panel latched a bad state at power-on
 *   5  backlight cycle    - backlight driver enable
 *   6  full LCD re-init   - anything in the LTDC configuration itself
 *   7  relaxed blanking    - the panel cannot lock to the current timings
 *
 * The ordering is deliberate: cheapest and least destructive first, so the
 * answer is as specific as possible. If rung 4 fixes it, the LTDC was never
 * the problem and the panel needs its power sequenced differently at boot. If
 * only rung 6 fixes it, something in LCD_Init() is not surviving a cold start.
 * If NOTHING fixes it, the fault is below software entirely.

/* ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * ms_configure_sleep_clocks() — what has to keep running while the CPU sleeps
 *
 * THE BUG THIS FIXES. Session 12 added a WFI to the kernel idle path and, on
 * this board, that broke the display: from a cold boot the home screen drew,
 * glitched, and greyed out within a couple of seconds, while UART, touch, the
 * SD card, the NPU and every task carried on perfectly.
 *
 * WFI on the STM32N6 enters CSleep, which stops the CPU — and, for every
 * peripheral, bus and memory whose LPEN bit is clear, stops its clock too.
 * The framebuffer lives at 0x34200000, in AXISRAM3-6. So each time the idle
 * task slept, the LTDC's DMA lost either its own clock, the AXI bus matrix
 * clock, or the RAM it was reading from. It kept scanning and kept driving
 * sync — every register we measured said the display was healthy — but it was
 * fetching nothing, so the panel starved and went grey. With the CPU idle
 * ~85% of the time, that is almost continuously.
 *
 * Why it looked like a hardware fault for six rounds:
 *   - The CPU's own reads of the framebuffer were always correct, because the
 *     CPU only reads when it is awake. The picture really was in RAM.
 *   - Every LTDC register read correct, for the same reason.
 *   - It vanished under the debugger: a halted core never executes WFI.
 *   - It vanished on a warm re-run, because those runs were being driven from
 *     the debugger too.
 * The measurement that finally isolated it was removing the WFI and changing
 * nothing else.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SETS. Only what a bus master genuinely needs while the CPU is
 * asleep — every extra bit here is power the device burns for nothing:
 *
 *   BUSLPENR   ACLKN, ACLKNC   the AXI bus matrix itself. Without this no
 *                              master reaches memory at all during sleep.
 *   MEMLPENR   AXISRAM3-6      the framebuffer (0x34200000) and the NPU
 *                              activation pools that share it.
 *   APB5LPENR  LTDC            the display controller.
 *              DCMIPP, CSI     the camera pipeline: it DMAs into the same
 *                              buffer during preview, while the UI task is
 *                              blocked and the CPU is therefore asleep.
 *   AHB5LPENR  DMA2D           the mascot blitter.
 *              SDMMC2          audit-log writes complete while the logger
 *                              task waits and the CPU sleeps.
 *              NPU             inference runs for hundreds of ms with every
 *                              task blocked on the AI event flag.
 *
 * Each of those is a master that moves data with no CPU involvement. Any one
 * of them left gated would produce the same class of fault as the display
 * did — silent, intermittent, and impossible to see in a register dump.
 *
 * DO NOT reduce this set without re-testing the flow that uses it, from a
 * COLD boot. That is the only condition under which the original fault ever
 * appeared.

     * Session 12 fix: declare EVERY I/O supply domain valid before touching
     * a single GPIO.
     *
     * The STM32N6's high-numbered GPIO banks are split across separately
     * supplied I/O domains (VDDIO2..VDDIO5), and a bank whose domain has not
     * been declared valid does not drive its pins. `ENGINEERING_LESSONS.md`
     * already records this from Session 06, where a missing
     * HAL_PWREx_EnableVddIO5() left the SDMMC2 pins unpowered and the driver
     * hung forever waiting on hardware that could not answer.
     *
     * The same trap was still live for the display, and much harder to see.
     * Mapping the domains from the ST BSP's own call sites:
     *
     *     VDDIO2 -> GPIOO      (BSP_LED_Init)
     *     VDDIO3 -> GPION      (SD card-detect)
     *     VDDIO4 -> GPIOH      (I2C1, camera)
     *     VDDIO5 -> GPIOC/E    (SDMMC2)
     *
     * LTDC's MspInit configures PE11 (LCD_VSYNC), PE1 (touch NRST) and
     * PH3/PH4/PH6 (colour bits B4/R4/B5) — i.e. pins in the VDDIO5 and
     * VDDIO4 domains — and enables NEITHER. Nothing enabled VDDIO5 until the
     * SD card was initialised, long after the panel had been configured and
     * the LTDC had started scanning out.
     *
     * Why this hid for so long: the PWR SVMCR "supply valid" bits live in the
     * always-on power domain and are NOT cleared by a system reset — only by
     * actually removing power. So once any run had enabled them, every
     * subsequent flash-and-run inherited valid domains and the display came up
     * fine. The bug only appears on a true cold boot, which is exactly the
     * situation the display fails in: dark, ghosting, fading out, while UART
     * (USART1, on the main VDD domain) carries on perfectly.
     *
     * Enabling all four here, once, before any peripheral init, removes the
     * ordering dependency entirely. The bits are idempotent, every one of
     * these rails is populated and powered on the STM32N6570-DK, and the BSP's

/**
 * @brief  Session 12: replace newlib's assert() handler with one that says
 *         something useful.
 *
 * The ST Edge AI runtime asserts rather than returning an error when the NPU's
 * epoch-controller blobs in external OSPI flash do not match the ones the
 * running binary expects. Stock newlib prints the raw expression and aborts:
 *
 *     assertion "ret == 1" failed: file ".../ll_aton_runtime.c", line 454,
 *     function: LL_ATON_RT_Init_Network
 *
 * which says nothing about the actual cause. That exact line has now cost this
 * project real bench time three separate times — session_08B_notes.md
 * Addendum 1 (weights never flashed), Addendum 2 (a second, undiscovered
 * weight pool), and session_12_notes.md Addendum 5 (the Release build laying
 * the blobs out in a different order than the flashed image). Every one of
 * them was the same underlying condition: **flash content does not match this
 * binary.**
 *
 * Providing this symbol overrides libc's copy at link time, because the
 * linker resolves objects before searching libraries.
 *
 * Ends in Error_Handler() (blinking RED) rather than a bare while(1), so a
 * board with no serial attached still shows that something failed rather than
 * appearing merely frozen.

/* ms_osal.h — MedSight OS Abstraction Layer
 *
 * PUBLIC API — defined Session 07 (FreeRTOS backend), unchanged since.
 * Session 11 swapped ms_osal.c's internals to µT-Kernel 3.0 calls without
 * changing a single signature here — that was the entire point of staging
 * the project behind this header from Session 07 onward.
 *
 * Session 12 WIDENS this API for the first time, by adding one primitive:
 * event flags (osal_flag_*). The original four — task / queue / mutex /
 * delay — were chosen in Session 07 as the lowest common denominator
 * between FreeRTOS and µT-Kernel, precisely so the Session 11 backend swap
 * would be mechanical. That worked, but it also left the finished firmware
 * talking to µT-Kernel only through primitives every RTOS has. FreeRTOS was
 * removed in Session 11, so there is no longer a second backend to keep the
 * surface narrow for, and the AI request/response handshake introduced this
 * session is a genuine multi-condition wait — exactly what µT-Kernel's
 * event flags exist for. See documents/milestones/session_12_notes.md
 * for the design reasoning, including the idioms that were evaluated and
 * deliberately NOT adopted.
 *
 * CONTRACT:
 *   No application module (.c file) outside ms_osal.c may include RTOS
 *   headers (FreeRTOS or µT-Kernel's <tk/tkernel.h>) or call any RTOS API
 *   directly. Everything goes through the functions declared here.
 *
 * API surface matches SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md §4 exactly.

 * Alarm handlers (Session 15)
 *
 * The SECOND widening of this API, and it earns its place the same way event
 * flags did in Session 12: there is a genuine consumer that no primitive
 * already here expresses.
 *
 * Session 15 gives the device a schedule. A dose window is a one-shot
 * deadline at an absolute time of day — "wake me at 08:00" — and the
 * alternatives are all worse:
 *   - a task polling the clock every N ms burns wake-ups forever to catch an
 *     event that happens three times a day, and directly damages the one
 *     power number this project has been measuring since Session 12;
 *   - osal_delay_ms() until the next dose blocks a whole task on nothing;
 *   - an event flag has no notion of time at all.
 * µT-Kernel's tk_cre_alm / tk_sta_alm is exactly this object: a one-shot
 * handler armed for a relative time, costing nothing until it fires. It is
 * also, not incidentally, the mechanism the original Program Plan named —
 * "The Camera Task wakes either on a scheduled µT-Kernel alarm (aligned to
 * dose times)". That sentence has been unimplemented since March.
 *
 * HANDLER CONTEXT — this is the constraint that shapes every use.
 * The handler runs in µT-Kernel's timer/interrupt context, not in a task. It
 * may not block, may not printf (session_11_notes.md Addendum 8 is the
 * record of what a slow handler path costs on this hardware), and may not
 * make a call that would wait. The only correct shape is: set an event flag
 * and return. A task does the work. state_machine.c/schedule handling
 * follows exactly that pattern — the handler is three lines.

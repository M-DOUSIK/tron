/* schedule_time_source.h — Session 15, Part B1
 *
 * SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md §2 has listed this module as "DESIGNED, NOT YET
 * WRITTEN" since Session 10. Nothing needed the time of day until carer mode
 * and scheduled dosing arrived, so it was never built. It is built now, to
 * the design that was already documented:
 *
 *   "the prototype uses a fast, configurable countdown timer standing in for
 *    real wall-clock scheduling ... The real RTC-driven daily schedule is the
 *    intended final behavior — implemented as a swappable time source (same
 *    pattern as the OSAL: one clearly isolated point of substitution)."
 *                                          — MASTER_PROJECT_PLAN.md §6
 *
 * THE SUBSTITUTION POINT IS THE DELIVERABLE, not the timer. Everything above
 * this header — state_machine.c, carer_ui.c — asks "what minute of the day is
 * it?" and "how long until HH:MM?" and never learns which of the two backends
 * answered. That is the same bargain ms_osal.h made with FreeRTOS and
 * µT-Kernel, and it is why the demo can compress a whole day into
 * MEDSIGHT_FAST_DAY_SECONDS without a single conditional anywhere else in
 * the firmware.
 *
 * ── The two modes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * MEDSIGHT_FAST_CLOCK == 0  (default; the real behaviour)
 *     Wall clock straight off the STM32N6's internal RTC, running from LSE
 *     if the board's 32.768 kHz crystal starts and LSI otherwise. The RTC is
 *     in the backup power domain, so the clock and the "has it ever been
 *     set" marker both survive a reset — which is the entire point. A
 *     schedule that forgets itself at every power cycle is not a schedule.
 *
 * MEDSIGHT_FAST_CLOCK == 1  (the demo)
 *     A whole 24-hour day is compressed into MEDSIGHT_FAST_DAY_SECONDS of
 *     real time, so a dose window opening, being met, and a later one being
 *     missed can all be filmed inside one take. The date still comes from
 *     the RTC; only the time-of-day axis is scaled. Nothing else changes:
 *     the same alarm, the same event flag, the same log lines.
 *
 * ── The scheduling axis ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Everything schedule-related in this firmware is expressed as a MINUTE OF
 * DAY, 0..1439. It is small enough to store four of them per patient in a
 * record that has to fit on an SD card, it has no timezone and no DST, and
 * it is exactly the granularity a medication schedule is written in. Seconds
 * appear only where a human reads a clock.

/* How much real time one compressed "day" takes in demo mode.
 *
 * 1440 s (24 real minutes) is chosen so that **one simulated minute is
 * exactly one real second**. That is not an aesthetic choice, it is the only
 * ratio that makes the feature testable by a person:
 *
 *   - A dose window is DOSE_WINDOW_MINUTES (30) SIMULATED minutes, so it
 *     lasts 30 real seconds — enough to walk to the device and tap through
 *     the instruct / preview / capture / dispense / confirm screens, which
 *     take fifteen to twenty-five seconds of real tapping.
 *   - Setting a dose two simulated minutes ahead means a two second wait.
 *   - Letting one lapse costs half a minute, not half an hour.
 *
 * The first draft used 240 s, which made one simulated minute 1/6 of a real
 * second and a whole dose window FIVE real seconds — physically impossible
 * to complete a dispense inside. The window has to be longer than the flow
 * it is a window for; that is the constraint this number comes from.
 *
 * Nobody ever waits a whole simulated day: you wait until the next dose. So
 * the day length only matters through this ratio, and "minutes on screen =
 * seconds in the room" is also the easiest thing to explain to whoever is
 * holding the camera. */

 * matter more than reading aloud.

/**
 * @brief Create the RTC access mutex. Call once from main(), alongside the

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Reading the RTC calendar is not one register read: the
 * ST HAL requires HAL_RTC_GetTime() before HAL_RTC_GetDate(), because the
 * first locks the calendar shadow registers and the second unlocks them.
 * Two tasks interleaving that pair can hand one of them a date that belongs
 * to the other's read.
 *
 * That was theoretical until Session 15 gave the RTC a second reader: the
 * logger task (priority 2) now stamps every line, while the UI task
 * (priority 4) reads the clock to draw it and to schedule. The UI preempts
 * the logger by construction, so the interleaving is not unlikely — it is
 * the normal case.
 *
 * Worth noting for the record: this is the FIRST genuine consumer of the
 * OSAL's mutex primitive. It has existed since Session 07 and
 * session_12_notes.md records that nothing in the codebase used it. It has
 * something to protect now.

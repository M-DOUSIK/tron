/* ui/registration_ui.h — Session 09: patient registration UI flow
 *
 * Owns the three new screens introduced this session (on-screen keyboard,
 * pill-count entry, confirm summary) between STATE_CAMERA_REGISTER's face
 * capture and gallery_add_patient()'s save. Per SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md
 * §3's documented exception, this module is allowed to call ai_vision.h's
 * gallery_add_patient() directly (unlike other UI modules, which only ever
 * go through state_machine.c) because registration is its own
 * self-contained flow.
 *
 * Touch is still polled once per tick by state_machine.c (touch_driver.h's
 * API, per the module-boundary rule that only touch_driver.c touches I2C2
 * directly) — state_machine.c passes the resulting (x,y) coordinate into
 * this module's handlers only on a rising-edge touch, exactly like the
 * existing home-screen/ready-screen button handling. This module does not
 * poll touch_driver.h itself, to avoid two independent edge-detectors
 * racing on the same physical touch.

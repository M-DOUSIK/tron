/* intake_hand.h — Stage 1C: find the HAND, not the pill. MedSight Session 16.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS, WHICH IS AN ADMISSION ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * Stage 1A detects a pill on the NPU, and on real hardware it does not work
 * well enough to decide anything. Five consecutive doses were logged with the
 * detector running: 2/54, 53/420, 6/243, 0/121 and 5/210 frames containing a
 * pill, with the box frequently on wall texture rather than on the object.
 * Retraining moved those numbers and did not change the conclusion.
 *
 * The reason is geometry, and it was knowable in advance:
 *
 *     ROI = 1.5 x face width  ~= 225 mm across a 160 px input = 0.71 px/mm
 *
 *     a 12 mm tablet   ->   8.5 px
 *     a hand           ->  ~64 px
 *
 * We were asking a detector to find an EIGHT PIXEL object in a frame whose
 * mean luminance measured 63..78, while the hand carrying it was seven times
 * larger in each dimension and about fifty times larger in area. At 8 px a
 * tablet and a patch of wall grain are not reliably different things. That is
 * not a training problem and no amount of retraining fixes it.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE FIELD ACTUALLY DOES ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Medication-adherence systems do not detect the pill. They decompose the act
 * into mini-activities - hand-to-mouth, pill-into-mouth, hand-off-mouth - and
 * detect the HAND and the MOUTH (AiCure, US10402982 and family). The
 * smartwatch literature detects the same gesture from wrist accelerometry and
 * never sees a pill at all (JMIR Hum Factors 2023;10:e42714). Nobody resolves
 * a 10 mm tablet at conversational distance, because it cannot be done.
 *
 * ── HOW THIS WORKS, AND WHY IT NEEDS NO MODEL ────────────────────────────
 *
 * A hand approaching a mouth is a large, moving, skin-toned region converging
 * on a point this device already knows for free - the mouth, from the
 * CenterFace landmarks Stage 1B decodes at no cost.
 *
 * So: subtract a BASELINE of the scene, mask to skin tone, take the centroid
 * of what is left. The baseline is captured once the ISP has settled, a few
 * frames into the watch.
 *
 *   THE FACE, THE WALL AND THE ROOM ARE ALL IN THE BASELINE, so they cancel
 *   exactly. What survives is what ARRIVED after the watch began - which is
 *   the question being asked. The false-positive class that dogged Stage 1A
 *   cannot occur here: a static surface produces no evidence at all.
 *
 *   A BASELINE, NOT THE PREVIOUS FRAME. Differencing consecutive frames
 *   lights up only the EDGES of a smooth moving object - its interior is
 *   unchanged between them - so a hand appears as a thin arc that no shape
 *   test can tell from scattered noise. That version found a hand in 0 of
 *   316 frames on hardware. Against a still reference the whole area of the
 *   hand differs, and the blob is solid enough to test.
 *
 * It runs on the M55 over a 40x40 decimation of a crop the service already
 * has in hand. Stage 1A is now sampled on one frame in four rather than
 * every frame, which is where the idle percentage went (42% during a watch
 * against 88% either side, measured on a run where the overlay drew ONE
 * time - so the overlay was never the cause and the inference always was).
 *
 * ── THE PILL DETECTOR IS NOT REMOVED ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Stage 1A stays and still runs. It is demoted from "the decision" to "a
 * corroborating signal": when it fires it raises confidence, its box still
 * draws on the overlay, and the claim that a YOLOv8n runs on the Neural-ART
 * NPU remains true and demonstrable. What changes is that a dose is no longer
 * decided by an 8-pixel object.

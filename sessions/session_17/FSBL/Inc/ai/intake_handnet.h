/* intake_handnet.h — Stage 1C, second implementation: a real hand model.
 * MedSight Session 16.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Src/ai/intake_hand.c finds a hand with a skin-tone mask over a
 * background-subtracted grid. It took four hardware rounds and never became
 * trustworthy, for a reason no amount of tuning could reach:
 *
 *     A MOVING EAR IS A MOVING SKIN REGION.
 *
 * At the level that stage works — skin-toned, solid, differs from a baseline —
 * an ear revealed by a turn of the head is indistinguishable from a hand. Size,
 * density and colour all say the same thing about both. Every fix was therefore
 * a geometric workaround (how far from the mouth, is the mouth inside the box,
 * has the blob moved), and each one traded one failure for another.
 *
 * This asks a model that actually knows what a hand is.
 *
 * ── THE MODEL ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * MediaPipe hand landmarks, `handlandmarks_full_224_int8.tflite`, from the ST
 * model zoo (`pose_estimation/handlandmarks`), Apache-2.0 — which is also a
 * licensing improvement on Stage 1A, whose YOLOv8n retrain left an unresolved
 * question in THIRD_PARTY_SOFTWARE.md about AGPL derivative works.
 *
 * 224x224x3 uint8 HWC in. Four float32 outputs, all preallocated, none
 * quantised — so unlike the pill detector there are no scale/zero-point tables
 * to load and nothing to dequantise. Measured on the generated graph, feeding
 * it this project's own compiled-in face image:
 *
 *   OUT_3  Dequantize_221   1 float   HAND PRESENCE      face: 0.0078
 *   OUT_4  Dequantize_230  63 floats  21 x (x, y, z), pixels in 224 space
 *   OUT_1  Dequantize_227   1 float   handedness (meaningless with no hand)
 *   OUT_2  Dequantize_233  63 floats  world/normalised landmarks, unused
 *
 * Presence reads 0.0078 on a face, 0.0078 on random noise and 0.0117 on flat
 * grey. The confusor that defeated the skin heuristic scores a flat zero here.
 *
 * ── THE FINGERTIPS ARE THE POINT ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is the part that matters most, and it retroactively settles an argument
 * this session had twice.
 *
 * MOUTH_ZONE_NORM_DIST was 0.15 face widths in the collaborator's design. It
 * was widened to 0.30 because a hand's CENTROID sits 40-60 mm below the lips at
 * the moment of delivery — and 0.30 then locked onto an ear, because
 * mouth-to-ear is 0.45-0.55 and the two ranges overlap once head pose is
 * allowed for. No single radius separates them.
 *
 * With real landmarks the problem does not arise. Keypoints 4 and 8 are the
 * THUMB TIP and INDEX TIP — the part that actually enters the mouth. A
 * fingertip is at the lips exactly when the pill is, so 0.15 is correct again,
 * for the same reason it was correct for a pill.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT COSTS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Activations are 1,197,952 bytes: about 220 KB in AI_ARENA and about 978 KB
 * in PSRAM across 13 large buffers, because the arena alone cannot hold it
 * (the compiler refuses outright — `total bytes left unallocated=3515456`).
 * The `.mpool` therefore opens xSPI1 at 0x90500000, clear of MobileFaceNet
 * (0x90000000-0x90310000) and of the intake camera frame (0x90400000).
 *
 * That has two consequences worth stating plainly:
 *
 *   THE PILL DETECTOR IS GONE. It needed the whole arena and the whole of
 *   0x73000000. This is a replacement, not an addition.
 *
 *   INFERENCE WILL BE SLOWER THAN ST'S PUBLISHED 20.75 ms, which is an
 *   all-internal figure. PSRAM is THROUGHPUT=MID LATENCY=HIGH. The real number
 *   is printed once per watch rather than guessed at here.

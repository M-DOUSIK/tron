/* intake_camera.h — the camera path for action recognition. Session 16 Part B.
 *
 * ── THIS IS THE HARD PART OF SESSION 16, AND IT IS NOT ABOUT THE MODEL ────
 *
 * Since Session 03 the DCMIPP has DMA'd straight into BUFFER_ADDRESS
 * (0x34200000), which IS the display framebuffer — camera preview works by
 * the camera and the display sharing one buffer. That is why Session 09 found
 * ("Bug 2", session_09_notes.md) that resuming the camera behind a drawn
 * screen erases it at ~30 fps, and why every screen from the face capture
 * onward is static UI with the camera STOPPED.
 *
 * Action recognition breaks that arrangement: it needs the camera running for
 * the whole STATE_CONFIRM_TAKEN window WHILE the UI keeps drawing the confirm
 * screen. Both cannot own one buffer. So the camera is pointed somewhere else
 * entirely — external PSRAM — and the framebuffer stays the UI's alone.
 *
 * ── WHERE, AND WHY THAT ADDRESS ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * PSRAM (XSPI1) is 16 MB at 0x90000000. It is NOT empty: MobileFaceNet uses
 * it as activation scratch. Session 16 established the extent the same way
 * MEMORY_MAP.md §2 established the AXISRAM one — by extracting every address
 * literal from the generated sources rather than trusting the pool
 * declaration, which claims all 16 MB:
 *
 *     0x90000000 .. 0x90310000     3,211,264 bytes   MobileFaceNet scratch
 *     0x90310000 .. 0x91000000    12.94 MB           free
 *
 * The intake frame sits at 0x90400000 — the next 4 MB boundary, leaving
 * ~0.9 MB of unclaimed slack above the embedder rather than butting against
 * it. One 800x480 RGB565 frame is 768,000 bytes, so it ends at 0x904BB800.
 *
 * ── LPEN: THE PART THAT COST SIX ROUNDS LAST TIME ────────────────────────
 *
 * session_12_notes.md Addendum 9 is a standing constraint, and this module is
 * the first thing since Session 12 to add a DMA destination. WFI on this part
 * enters CSleep, which stops the clock of every peripheral, bus and memory
 * whose LPEN bit is clear. A DMA master writing into a gated destination
 * produces a silent, intermittent fault that no register dump can see,
 * because the CPU only reads when it is awake.
 *
 * ms_configure_sleep_clocks() covers AXISRAM3-6, the AXI bus matrix, LTDC,
 * DCMIPP, CSI, DMA2D, SDMMC2 and the NPU. It does NOT cover XSPI1, because
 * until now nothing DMA'd there. TWO bits are needed, not one:
 *
 *     RCC_AHB5LPENR_XSPI1LPEN    the PSRAM controller itself
 *     RCC_AHB5LPENR_XSPIMLPEN    the XSPI MANAGER, which every memory-mapped
 *                                access is routed through — gating it stalls
 *                                the transfer just as completely
 *
 * Both are added in ms_configure_sleep_clocks() in the same change as this
 * file, which is what the standing rule requires, and the whole thing MUST be
 * tested from a COLD BOOT — the only condition under which the original fault
 * ever appeared.
 *
 * Worth recording while here: XSPI2LPEN is also clear, and the NPU reads its
 * weights from OSPI NOR at 0x71000000. That has never bitten only because the
 * ST runtime is built LL_ATON_OSAL_BARE_METAL and POLLS, so the CPU is awake
 * for the whole inference and never sleeps mid-run. It is latent, not live —
 * but it is the same fault shape, and if inference is ever made to block on
 * an OS primitive instead of spinning, that bit becomes mandatory.

/* intake.h — action recognition: did the patient actually take the pill?
 * MedSight Session 16.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This subsystem CORROBORATES the "✓ I Took It" button. It never replaces
 * it and it never gates a dose. That was decided by the project owner
 * before this session started (session_15_notes.md Addendum 2), and the
 * reason is worth restating at the top of the header rather than buried:
 * the button is proven on hardware and a patient understands it, whereas a
 * model failure that could block a confirmation would mean a dose this
 * device is unable to record. The model's verdict becomes EVIDENCE in the
 * audit log — "(on time, gesture confirmed)" — and nothing more.
 *
 * Everything here is behind MEDSIGHT_ACTION_RECOGNITION (see below). With
 * it at 0 the firmware behaves exactly as Session 15 did.
 *
 * ── THE THREE STAGES, AND WHERE EACH ONE RUNS ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The design is a collaborator's (tools/action_recogntion/summary.md). It
 * is a three-stage pipeline, NOT the temporal CNN this project assumed for
 * four months, and that distinction is why the session was affordable:
 *
 *   Stage 1A  pill detector          YOLOv8n INT8 on the Neural-ART NPU
 *   Stage 1B  mouth position         DECODED from the CenterFace detector
 *                                    that has run since Session 08B
 *   Stage 2   geometric features     plain C, no NPU        (intake_features.c)
 *   Stage 3   temporal decision      rule-based state machine (intake_fsm.c)
 *
 * Stage 1B is the cheap surprise of this session. CenterFace emits five
 * landmarks — two eyes, a nose and BOTH MOUTH CORNERS — on the same 32x32
 * grid as its heatmap, on a tensor ai_vision.c has always #define'd as
 * FD_OUT_LANDMARKS and has never once read. So mouth tracking costs no
 * second model, no extra inference and no extra memory: it is a decode of
 * something the existing 209 ms detector already produced.
 *
 * Stage 3 needs no neural network at all. The collaborator's own
 * main/main.py implements it as GuardedIntakeStateMachine — named states
 * and thresholds — even though their summary.md proposes a "Tiny TCN" as
 * future work. What is ported here is what they actually built and ran.
 *
 * ── WHAT WE LOST RELATIVE TO THEIR PYTHON, STATED PLAINLY ────────────────
 *
 * Their Stage 1B was MediaPipe Face Mesh (468 landmarks); ours is
 * CenterFace (5). Their pill tracker also used MediaPipe Hands. Neither
 * runs on this part. Three capabilities therefore do not exist here, and
 * they are proxied or dropped — never faked:
 *
 *  1. MOUTH-OPEN DETECTION IS GONE. Two mouth corners give a centre and a
 *     width. They do not give an upper and a lower lip, so there is no
 *     signal behind mouth_opening and none behind is_open. Their state
 *     machine used is_open in two transitions. Rather than invent a value,
 *     the transition that depended on it now resolves to UNCERTAIN — see
 *     intake_fsm.c's AT_MOUTH case. A device that says "I could not tell"
 *     is behaving correctly; one that says CONSUMED on no evidence is not.
 *
 *  2. THE INNER-LIP POLYGON IS GONE. Their APPROACHING->AT_MOUTH test was
 *     a point-in-polygon against the inner lip contour. Ours is a radial
 *     test about the mouth centre, scaled by mouth width. That is a proxy
 *     for the POLYGON, and it is a fair one because a mouth is roughly an
 *     ellipse about that centre. It is NOT a proxy for is_open, and must
 *     never be read as one.
 *
 *  3. HAND TRACKING IS GONE, so there is no pinch point and no kinematic
 *     estimation of an occluded pill. Their tracker kept a pill "alive"
 *     for up to 30 frames behind a hand by offsetting from the pinch
 *     point. We cannot, so an occluded pill is simply not visible, and
 *     Stage 3's tolerance for that is what RETREAT_CONFIRM_FRAMES buys.
 *     It also means Stage 1A runs on a MOUTH-centred ROI rather than a
 *     HAND-centred one.
 *
 * ── FRAME-BUFFER OWNERSHIP (do not break this) ───────────────────────────
 *
 * SOFTWARE_ARCHITECTURE.md §9 requires exactly one owner of BUFFER_ADDRESS
 * at a time. Action recognition runs on the EXISTING ai task at priority 3
 * with the same event-flag handshake — there is no second AI task — and it
 * reads camera frames from the PSRAM ring (Session 16 Part B), never from
 * BUFFER_ADDRESS. That is what lets the UI keep drawing the confirm screen
 * while the camera runs.

 *  AXISRAM6 ends at 0x343BFFF7, which caps it at 229,368 bytes — still short

 *
 *  The alternative was PSRAM, which is NPU-reachable and has 12.94 MB free.

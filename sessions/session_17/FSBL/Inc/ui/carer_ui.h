/* ui/carer_ui.h — Session 15: the passcode gate and carer mode
 *
 * Two things live in this module, and they live together on purpose.
 *
 * 1. THE PASSCODE GATE. One prompt screen, one validation routine, two entry
 *    points: carer mode itself, and REGISTER PATIENT (§B2a). The session
 *    brief is explicit about why they must be the same code — "two copies of
 *    a password check is two places to get the comparison, the rate-limiting,
 *    or the hash wrong" — and it is right. There is exactly one
 *    carer_pass_check() in this firmware.
 *
 * 2. CARER MODE. The screens a carer uses to set the device up: the clock,
 *    each patient's dose schedule and dose size, the event log, and deleting
 *    a patient.
 *
 * ── Why REGISTER PATIENT is now gated (B2a) ──────────────────────────────
 *
 * This is the most important security change in the session and it closes a
 * real hole, not a theoretical one. Until now anyone could walk up to the
 * device, tap REGISTER PATIENT, enrol their own face and their own dose
 * size, and then use DISPENSE to be handed medication — and the audit log
 * would record it as a legitimate, face-matched dispense to a registered
 * patient, because from the device's point of view that is exactly what it
 * was. Face recognition was doing its job perfectly. The gallery it matched
 * against would accept anyone who asked.
 *
 * Every other control in this device rests on that gallery being
 * trustworthy. With enrolment open, identification is theatre.
 *
 * The gate is at the START of registration, not the end. Asking afterwards
 * would waste the user's time, would mean a face and a name had already been
 * taken from someone who was never authorised, and would leave a half-written
 * flow to unwind. Ask first and everything downstream is already authorised.
 *
 * ── What the passcode actually protects against ──────────────────────────
 *
 * A curious patient or a visitor. Nothing more, and the documents say so:
 * this board has no secure element, the SD card is unencrypted, and the hash
 * below is a 32-bit FNV-1a — it would not survive five minutes of attention
 * from someone holding the card. That honesty is worth more than the feature
 * (COMPLIANCE_PRIVACY_POSTURE.md §6).

/* ── The build-time default passcode ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A fresh device with no card, or a card with no carer.cfg on it, has to be
 * usable — otherwise the first thing a carer must do requires the thing they
 * cannot yet do. So there is a default, it is documented in the README, and
 * carer mode can change it (the new value's hash is written to the card).
 *
 * Digits only. A numeric passcode rather than a typed word is a deliberate
 * choice for this device: the keypad's targets are four times the area of
 * the QWERTY keys registration uses, which matters when the person holding
 * the device may be a carer in a hurry or an elderly user's relative, and
 * nothing about a word is more secure than digits against the threat model
 * above. */

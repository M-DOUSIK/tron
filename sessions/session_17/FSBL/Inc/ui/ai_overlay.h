/* ai_overlay.h — draw what the models actually see. MedSight Session 16.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every claim this project makes about its AI is, on the device itself,
 * invisible: a face is matched, a pill is tracked, a verdict is written, and
 * all a person watching sees is a screen that changes. The log knows. The
 * viewer does not.
 *
 * This module renders the models' own output onto the LCD — the detector's
 * face box, the five CenterFace landmarks, the pill detector's box, the ROI it
 * searched, and the intake state machine's current state. It is the difference
 * between telling a judge the NPU is working and showing them.
 *
 * ── THE FRAME-BUFFER RULE, WHICH DIFFERS BETWEEN THE TWO VIEWS ───────────
 *
 * This is the part to understand before changing anything here, because the
 * two views have genuinely different constraints and only one of them is
 * obvious.
 *
 * **The face view must wait.** Both face networks' activation scratch is
 * hardcoded by ST's codegen to overlap BUFFER_ADDRESS, so between
 * ai_vision_capture_request() and ai_vision_capture_wait() the AI task owns
 * the framebuffer and NOTHING here may draw. ai_overlay_draw_capture() is
 * therefore called only after the capture handshake has completed, when the
 * hold buffer is stable and the NPU has let go.
 *
 * **The intake view does not have to wait**, and that is a consequence of a
 * deliberate Session 16 decision rather than luck. The pill detector's
 * activations were placed in AI_ARENA at 0x34388000 — chosen precisely because
 * it overlaps nothing the display uses (MEMORY_MAP.md §8) — and the camera
 * streams to PSRAM at 0x90400000 rather than to the framebuffer. So during an
 * intake watch the UI owns BUFFER_ADDRESS outright, and can render a LIVE
 * overlay while the NPU is mid-inference. The device has never been able to
 * show a camera image with anything drawn on top before; Session 09's "Bug 2"
 * is the record of the last attempt.
 *
 * ── COST ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Both views scale the source image down with a nearest-neighbour CPU loop
 * into a small window rather than blitting a full 800x480 frame. At the sizes
 * below that is ~60k pixel writes per refresh, and the live view is throttled
 * well under the UI task's 10 ms tick. Nothing here uses DMA2D, so nothing
 * here needs a new LPEN bit — see session_12_notes.md Addendum 9 for why that
 * sentence is in this header at all.

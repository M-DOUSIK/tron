/* dispenser.h — MedSight physical dispenser (Session 17)
 *
 * One hopper: a 28BYJ-48 unipolar stepper turning a turntable through a
 * ULN2003 Darlington array, and a 3-pin IR break-beam module counting each
 * pill as it slides past.
 *
 * THE ONE IDEA THIS MODULE EXISTS FOR. The stepper is open-loop and stalls
 * silently, so steps commanded is not pills dispensed. The motor stops when
 * the IR beam has counted the requested number of pills, not when a timer
 * expires. If the step count and the beam count disagree, the beam is right.
 * documents/MECHANICAL_DESIGN.md's rejection of a sliding gate rests on
 * exactly this: a gate cannot know how many pills went through it.
 *
 * THE PILLS SLIDE DOWN A RAMP, THEY DO NOT FALL. That inverts the usual
 * break-beam assumptions and every tuning constant in dispenser.c follows
 * from it — see the block comment above MS_IR_MIN_BREAK_MS there.
 *
 * BUILD SWITCH. With MEDSIGHT_PHYSICAL_DISPENSER at 0 this module still
 * compiles and links, dispenser_dispense() reports DISPENSE_NOT_READY, and
 * state_machine.c falls back to the Session 10 simulated animation. That is
 * session_17.md Part C, and it is not optional: the full flow has to remain
 * demonstrable on a board with no hardware attached.

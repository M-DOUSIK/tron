/* buzzer.h — MedSight audible alerts (Session 17, Part E)
 *
 * THE PROGRAM PLAN'S FOURTH BOX. tools/Program Plan 54916.pdf §5 lists an
 * "Alert / Feedback Module: Buzzer, LED, optional small display output", and
 * §6 shows the Alert Task as the fourth stage of Camera -> Inference ->
 * Validation -> Alert, driving "a buzzer and LED (green = correct, red =
 * incorrect/missed)". The device has had no audible feedback at all until
 * now, so this closes a commitment from our own submitted plan rather than
 * adding a new idea.
 *
 * AN ACTIVE PIEZO BUZZER, not a passive one. session_17.md Part E1
 * recommended passive on a timer PWM channel because different pitches let a
 * confirmation chirp sound unlike a missed-dose alert. The project owner has
 * an active piezo, so the patterns below distinguish themselves by RHYTHM
 * instead — which costs nothing that matters here and arguably reads better
 * for the users this device is for: a long insistent pulse train is easier to
 * learn than a semitone. The saving is real: one GPIO, no timer, and TIM16
 * stays free.
 *
 * WHO EACH SOUND IS FOR. Settled in Session 15 and not re-litigated here:
 *   - BUZZ_DOSE_REMINDER is for the PATIENT, at the opening edge of a window.
 *   - BUZZ_DOSE_MISSED is for a CARER, at the closing edge. A missed window
 *     is by definition the case where the patient did not respond to the
 *     on-screen reminder, so beeping harder at them is nagging. This one
 *     fetches somebody else, who opens carer mode -> DOSE HISTORY.
 * That is why BUZZ_DOSE_MISSED is the only pattern built from long tones.

 *

 *         the new one is more important, and is dropped if it is not — a tap
 *         tick must never interrupt a missed-dose alert.
 *
 *         NOT safe from handler context. The schedule alarm handler sets its

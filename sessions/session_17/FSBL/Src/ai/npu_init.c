     *
     * UM/community "STM32N6 boot ROM explained": the boot ROM handles its own
     * data in AXI SRAM2 by configuring RISAF2, and "configures seven regions
     * inside RISAF2 and dynamically sets each region depending on the boot ROM
     * code phase being executed". Those regions are still configured when it
     * hands over - the ROM does not put them back.
     *
     * This project deliberately skipped RISAF_Config(), with the comment
     * "to avoid accidental compartmentalization, matching the ST official
     * example". That is correct for DEVELOPMENT boot, where the debugger
     * loads us into SRAM, RISAF is at its permissive reset defaults, and
     * reconfiguring it could only narrow access that is already open.
     *
     * Booting from external flash it is exactly backwards: the ROM and the
     * first-stage loader have already narrowed things, and RISAF_Config() is
     * the function that opens them back up - RISAF12_S is OCTOSPI2 at
     * 0x70000000, the NOR holding the weights, and RISAF11_S is OCTOSPI1.
     * BFAR=0x71026FC0 is a FILTERED address, not an absent one.
     *
     * Before the XSPI work, not after, because the filters have to be open
     * before anything touches the flash. Clocks first: RISAF cannot be
     * configured for an IP that is not clocked. */

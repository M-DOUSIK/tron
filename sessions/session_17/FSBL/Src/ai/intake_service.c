/* intake_service.c — Session 16. Orchestration for action recognition.
 *
 * Runs Stages 1A, 1B, 2 and 3 for one dose, on the EXISTING ai task at
 * priority 3. See Inc/ai/intake.h for why there is no second AI task.
 *
 * ── THE CONTRACT WITH THE UI, WHICH IS THE WHOLE SAFETY ARGUMENT ─────────
 *
 * The UI never waits for this. It calls intake_begin() when the confirm
 * screen goes up, keeps polling touch at its usual 10 ms, and reads
 * intake_peek() only at the instant the patient taps "✓ I Took It" — to
 * decide which SUFFIX the audit line gets, never whether to write one.
 *
 * Every failure path in this file therefore ends in "the verdict stays
 * uncertain": no camera, no detector, no face, a stalled pipe, a timeout.
 * None of them can stop a dose being confirmed. That is deliberate and it is
 * the reason this feature was allowed to exist at all
 * (session_15_notes.md Addendum 2, prompts/session_16.md Part D).

 * THE VERDICT RESTS ON MOUTH OCCLUSION
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Stage 1C searches the ROI for a hand and Stage 1A searches it for a pill.
 * Both work, in the sense that they find things; neither could be stopped
 * from finding the WRONG thing, because a search over a whole region has more
 * ways to succeed than the question has correct answers. Four hardware rounds
 * went into rejecting ears, re-lit jawlines and wall texture one at a time.
 *
 * The occlusion test asks a different question: is the MOUTH covered? The
 * mouth position is already known from the landmarks and the ROI is centred
 * on it, so this is a measurement on one small known patch rather than a
 * search. An ear is not in the patch. Nothing outside the mouth can produce
 * a false positive, whatever it is and however it moves.
 *
 * OCCLUDE_PCT is how much of that patch must be covered. 55% rather than
 * something higher because a hand delivering a tablet approaches from below
 * and covers the lower lip and chin first - demanding near-total coverage
 * would only fire at the deepest part of the gesture, if at all.
 *
 * The hand and pill stages are KEPT, for the box the overlay draws and for
 * the corroboration flag that decides whether the audit line may say "pill"
 * or must say "hand". They no longer decide anything. */

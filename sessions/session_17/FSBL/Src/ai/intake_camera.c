/* How much of the face width the ROI spans, as a percentage.
 *
 * ── THIS CONSTANT SETS THE APPARENT SIZE OF A PILL, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE
 *    BALLGAME FOR THE DETECTOR ────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The counter-intuitive part first: **standing closer to the device does not
 * help.** The ROI is defined as a multiple of the FACE WIDTH, and the face and
 * the pill shrink together with distance, so the pill's size in the detector's
 * 160x160 input is independent of how far away the patient stands. It is fixed
 * by one ratio: pill_diameter / (mult x face_width).
 *
 * Working it through for a 150 mm face and a 160 px input:
 *
 *   object                     at mult 2.0    at mult 1.0
 *   GEMS / small tablet  12 mm      6.4 px        12.8 px
 *   typical tablet       10 mm      5.3 px        10.7 px
 *   bottle cap           28 mm     14.9 px        29.9 px
 *
 * The detector was trained on pills spanning **17-49 px** at this input
 * (median 28), so at mult 2.0 a real pill is far outside the distribution it
 * learned. That is not a bug in the model; it is the deployment scenario —
 * "pill near a face, whole face in frame" — being genuinely different from the
 * close-up photographs the public dataset is made of.
 *
 * Measured on hardware at mult 2.0: a ~28 mm bottle cap (14.9 px) was detected
 * 8-18 times per watch. So ~15 px is the practical floor for this model, and
 * 6.4 px is hopeless.
 *
 * ── WHY 100 AND NOT TIGHTER ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Tightening the ROI makes the pill bigger but shrinks the field the geometry
 * can see, and Stage 3's thresholds are expressed in FACE WIDTHS:
 *
 *   AT_MOUTH triggers at   norm_dist < 0.15 face widths
 *   RETREAT  triggers at   norm_dist > 0.35 face widths
 *
 * So the ROI must span at least +/-0.35 face widths about the mouth, i.e. a
 * multiplier of 0.7, or the retreat transition can never fire because the pill
 * has left the crop before it gets far enough away. That is the floor.
 *
 * -- WHY 150, WITH BOTH ENDS MEASURED --------------------------------------
 *
 * 200 was the original guess. 100 was then set from an offline curve that
 * measured pill SIZE only, and it made the device dramatically WORSE on
 * hardware: 1-3 detections per watch against 8-18 at 200. Halving this
 * constant also halves the FIELD OF VIEW, and a hand carrying a pill to a
 * mouth spends most of its travel more than half a face width away.
 * Measuring one of the two variables a constant controls is not measuring
 * the constant (session_16_notes.md Addendum 8).
 *
 * 150 is set from both, against the small-object detector retrained at this
 * input size (Addendum 11):
 *
 *   field of view   +/-0.75 face widths - double the 0.35 the RETREAT
 *                   transition needs, so the geometry keeps real margin
 *   12 mm object    8.5 px -> 72% offline, ~36% expected on hardware, which
 *                   over a 100-frame watch gives a ~96% chance of the
 *                   three-consecutive lock
 *   28 mm object    19.9 px -> ~98%
 *
 * A true 10-12 mm pill sits at the edge of what a 160 px input resolves at
 * conversational distance. That is geometry, not a model deficiency, and
 * further retraining does not move it much; a ~20 mm object is the reliable
 * case. */
/* ── 250 SINCE THE HAND MODEL: THE CROP MUST CONTAIN THE GESTURE ────────
 *
 * Everything above this line is the reasoning for a PILL detector, where the
 * only question was how many pixels an 8 mm object occupies. Stage 1C now
 * runs a hand model, and a different question dominates: is the hand INSIDE
 * THE CROP AT ALL?
 *
 * At 150 it usually was not. Measured on hardware, ROI 228 px centred on a
 * mouth at (439,289) covers x 325-553, y 175-403 of an 800x480 frame — a
 * window around the face and nothing below it. A hand travelling up to the
 * mouth is outside that box for most of its journey, so the model had nothing
 * to detect until the gesture was already finished. That is exactly what the
 * logs showed: 3 detections in 33 frames, and a box that only ever appeared
 * on the mouth.
 *
 * 250 gives ~380 px at the same framing: x 249-629, y 99-479 — down to the
 * bottom of the frame, so a hand is in view for the whole approach.
 *
 * WHAT IT COSTS. The hand gets smaller in the model's 224 px input:
 *
 *     at 150   228 px ROI  ->  a ~90 mm hand is ~88 px, 39% of the input
 *     at 250   380 px ROI  ->  the same hand is ~53 px, 24% of the input
 *
 * MediaPipe's landmark net expects a tight crop from a palm detector, so
 * smaller is worse for it. This is a real trade and it is made deliberately:
 * a hand the model sees at lower confidence is worth more than a hand it
 * never sees. PRESENCE_T moves down with it.
 *
 * NONE OF THE GEOMETRY CHANGES. Stage 2 measures in FACE WIDTHS, not in ROI
 * fractions, so MOUTH_ZONE_NORM_DIST and the containment gate mean exactly
 * what they meant before. That is the property that makes this safe to change
 * — and it is why widening it here is not a repeat of Addendum 8, where
 * shrinking the ROI silently changed what the thresholds were measuring. */
/* REVERTED TO 150. The widening to 250 above was aimed at a problem this is
 * not: it assumed the hand was missed because it was outside the crop, and
 * the truth is that MediaPipe's LANDMARK net is not a detector at all. It is
 * fed a tight, hand-filling crop by a palm detector in the real pipeline, and
 * we have no palm detector - so it reports presence reliably only when the
 * hand is centred and large, which (the ROI being centred on the mouth) means
 * "hand at the mouth". Widening the crop made the hand SMALLER and pushed it
 * further out of distribution, i.e. the opposite of the intent.
 *
 * 150 is the value that was measured to work for the case this device
 * actually needs. The reasoning above the reverted block is still the right
 * reasoning for the FIELD OF VIEW the geometry needs. */

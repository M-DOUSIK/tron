/* ai_vision.c — MedSight face recognition pipeline (Session 09B / clean do-over
 * of Session 08B).
 *
 * Replaces the Session 08A throwaway NPU test model with the real two-model
 * pipeline: CenterFace face detector -> FaceID embedder -> gallery match.
 * Model wrapper code (stai_fd.*, stai_faceid.*, fd.c, faceid.c, *_ecblobs.h)
 * is copied verbatim from the proven PeleAB reference project
 * (tools/PeleAB_repo/Model; that folder was named scratch/ at the time) per
 * documents/prompts/session_08B.md; only this file, ai_vision.h, and the
 * sd_logger.c file-I/O additions are original to MedSight.
 *
 * IMPORTANT MEMORY HAZARD (found during this session, not in the original
 * briefing): both generated networks' activation scratch pools are hardcoded
 * by STM32Cube.AI codegen to overlap BUFFER_ADDRESS (0x34200000) — see the
 * epoch-block cache-invalidate calls in faceid.c/fd.c and PeleAB's own
 * Doc/Application-Overview.md ("activations | 507 KB | 0x34200000 | NPURAMS").
 * That address is our live camera framebuffer. Running either network
 * therefore clobbers the camera frame currently sitting there. The pipeline
 * below copies the region it needs (a centered crop) into a static hold
 * buffer BEFORE calling stai_fd_run(), and does all further cropping (for the
 * embedder) from that hold buffer, never from BUFFER_ADDRESS again once
 * inference has started. Camera DMA must also be stopped by the caller
 * (state_machine.c) before calling ai_vision_run_pipeline() — see
 * ai_vision.h's contract note.

/* ── Stage 1B (Session 16): the mouth, decoded from a tensor we already had
 *
 * CenterFace emits FIVE LANDMARKS alongside its heatmap, on the same 32x32
 * grid, as output index FD_OUT_LANDMARKS. This file has #define'd that index
 * since Session 08B and has never read the tensor. Confirmed against the
 * generated header rather than assumed:
 *
 *     STAI_FD_OUT_2_CHANNEL (10)     5 landmarks x (y,x)
 *     STAI_FD_OUT_2_HEIGHT  (32)     same grid as the heatmap
 *     STAI_FD_OUT_2_WIDTH   (32)
 *     STAI_FD_OUT_2_SHAPE   {1,32,32,10}   -> channel-LAST
 *
 * So Session 16's mouth tracking costs no second model, no extra inference
 * and no extra memory. It is a decode, which is why this session was
 * affordable at all — the collaborator's design used MediaPipe Face Mesh,
 * which cannot run on this part.
 *
 * VALUE ENCODING. CenterFace's published post-processing reads each landmark
 * as a FRACTION OF THE FACE BOX, in (y,x) channel pairs:
 *
 *     lm_y = lm[j*2 + 0] * box_h + box_y
 *     lm_x = lm[j*2 + 1] * box_w + box_x
 *
 * The (y,x) pair ordering matches how decode_best_face_box() above already
 * reads the offset and scale heads, which is corroborating evidence for it
 * on THIS export rather than just on the public model.
 *
 * WHAT MUST BE CHECKED ON HARDWARE, NOT ASSUMED. Two things, and
 * prompts/session_16.md Part 0 is explicit that they are checks and not
 * facts. Both are printed by ai_vision_dump_landmarks() so a human can look
 * at real numbers from a real face:
 *   1. that these decode to sane pixel coordinates at all;
 *   2. THE ORDERING. The conventional CenterFace order is
 *      (eye, eye, nose, mouth_corner, mouth_corner) — indices 3 and 4 for
 *      the mouth — but which eye comes first varies between published
 *      implementations, and nothing guarantees this export follows any of
 *      them. If a capture shows the "mouth" sitting on the eyes, change
 *      LM_MOUTH_L/LM_MOUTH_R and nothing else.
 *
 * THE LIMITATION THIS CREATES IS REAL AND IS NOT PAPERED OVER. Two mouth
 * corners give a centre and a WIDTH. They do not give an upper and a lower
 * lip, so there is no mouth-open signal on this device and none is
 * fabricated. Inc/ai/intake.h and Src/ai/intake_fsm.c both record what that

 * NPU service task (Session 12)
 *
 * See ai_vision.h for why this exists. The short version: until Session 11
 * the NPU pipeline ran synchronously inside the UI task and never touched an
 * OS primitive, so the AI sat alongside µT-Kernel rather than being mediated
 * by it. It now runs in its own task, one priority level below the UI, and
 * the UI asks for a capture through a µT-Kernel event flag.
 *
 * Why an event flag and not a queue: the UI's wait has THREE outcomes it must
 * distinguish in a single blocking call — face found, no face, and "the AI
 * task never answered". An OR-wait on (DONE | FAIL) with a timeout expresses
 * exactly that in one tk_wai_flg(), where a queue would need either a second
 * object or a polling loop. The flag pattern that satisfied the wait tells
 * the caller which of the two arms fired; the timeout covers the third.
 *
 * There is no lock around the result buffers below and none is needed: the
 * flag handshake makes access strictly alternating. The UI writes nothing;
 * the AI task writes s_capture_* only between receiving REQUEST and setting
 * DONE/FAIL, and the UI reads them only after that flag arrives.

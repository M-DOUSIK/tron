 * PIN BUDGET. Traced against this firmware's live consumers before a line of
 * this file was written — the LTDC block in stm32n6xx_hal_msp.c, the I2C
 * defines in stm32n6570_discovery_bus.h, and the SD/camera/LED assignments in
 * the BSP. All five pins sit on the main VDD I/O domain, so Session 06's
 * unpowered-bank trap (ENGINEERING_LESSONS.md) cannot apply to any of them;
 * no HAL_PWREx_EnableVddIOn() call is needed for GPIOA or GPIOD.
 *
 *   Arduino A0  PA5    ULN2003 IN1
 *   Arduino A1  PA9    ULN2003 IN2
 *   Arduino A2  PA10   ULN2003 IN3
 *   Arduino A3  PA12   ULN2003 IN4
 *   Arduino D2  PD0    IR module OUT   (EXTI0)
 *
 *   Arduino D10 PA3    RESERVED, unwired — buzzer, TIM16_CH1 AF1 (Part E)
 *   Arduino D14 PC1 and D15 PH9 are the camera's I2C1 and are OFF LIMITS.
 *
 * The four coil lines are one bank at four consecutive header pins, so a
 * half-step is a single atomic GPIOA->BSRR write: no read-modify-write, and
 * no torn coil pattern if the UI task is preempted mid-step.
 *
 * NO NEW DMA DESTINATION, so session_12_notes.md Addendum 9's standing rule
 * does not bite here: nothing in this module is a bus master, and
 * ms_configure_sleep_clocks() needs no new LPEN bit. The one sleep-related
 * consequence is latency, not loss — see the note above the ISR.

 * Pins
 *
 * TWO COIL PIN SETS, selectable with one number, because the first hardware
 * run never lit a single LED on the driver board and "the header pin is not
 * what we think" is one of the few explanations a firmware change can test.
 *
 *   MS_COIL_PINSET 0   CN7, the ANALOG header   A0-A3  = PA5/PA9/PA10/PA12
 *   MS_COIL_PINSET 1   CN11/CN12, DIGITAL       D3/D5/D6/D9 = PE9/PE10/PE13/PE14
 *
 * Both sets are one GPIO bank, so a half-step stays a single atomic BSRR
 * write either way. Both are free of every live consumer in this firmware —
 * traced against the LTDC block in stm32n6xx_hal_msp.c, the I2C defines in
 * stm32n6570_discovery_bus.h, and the SD/camera/audio/LED assignments in the
 * BSP.
 *
 * ONE DIFFERENCE WORTH KNOWING. GPIOA sits on the main VDD I/O domain, which
 * is powered from reset and needs no HAL_PWREx call. GPIOE sits on VDDIO5 —
 * which main() already enables unconditionally at boot (the Session 12 fix,
 * ENGINEERING_LESSONS.md), so set 1 is safe, but it depends on that call in a
 * way set 0 does not. If set 1 is ever used on a board where that enable has
 * been removed, Session 06's trap is live again and the pins read and drive
 * nothing at all, silently.

/* THE PILLS SLIDE. This is the constant that the ramp changes.
 *
 * A 10 mm pill in free fall crosses the beam at 1-2 m/s — 5-10 ms. Sliding
 * at 0.2-0.5 m/s it breaks the beam for 20-50 ms or more. A long break is
 * therefore the SIGNAL, not noise, and a debounce window sized for a drop
 * would throw away real counts.
 *
 * The dominant error also flips. Free fall separates pills; a ramp lets them
 * slide nose-to-tail in contact, so TWO pills can produce ONE continuous
 * break. Aggressive debouncing makes that worse, not better. So this is set
 * to the smallest value that suppresses genuine LM393 chatter (sub-millisecond
 * to a couple of ms) and nothing more.
 *
 * Anything shorter than this is discarded as chatter and logged as such.

 *   chatter               0-1 ms, hundreds of them
 * The two populations do not overlap and are an order of magnitude apart, so

/* ── IR POLARITY, and the bug that made this a setting ────────────────────
 *
 * The first hardware run learned the polarity backwards and reported an
 * instant JAM on a perfectly good sensor. dispenser_init() sampled the line
 * ONCE, 5 ms after configuring the pin, and locked that value in as "idle":
 *
 *     dispenser: ... idle=LOW -> break=HIGH
 *     dispenser: beam ALREADY broken at start
 *     dispenser: JAM - 0 of 3 counted in 1495 ms
 *
 * The line read LOW at boot and HIGH by the time a dose was dispensed, so
 * every clear beam looked broken. One unvalidated sample is not enough to
 * decide something the entire count depends on.
 *
 * Three fixes, in order of how much they are trusted:
 *   1. MS_IR_IDLE_FORCE, below — once the level is MEASURED on the bench,
 *      state it here and nothing has to infer anything ever again.
 *   2. Failing that, the level is re-learned at the START OF EVERY DISPENSE
 *      and required to hold still for MS_IR_SETTLE_MS first. A line that is
 *      still moving is reported rather than silently believed.
 *   3. A pre-existing beam state never arms the jam timer. A stall is a
 *      condition that BEGINS during a dispense; something already true when
 *      we started is not a stall, and treating it as one is what turned a
 *      wrong guess into a 1.5-second failure instead of a slow one.
 *
 * Set to 0 or 1 to force it; leave at -1 to keep learning it.
 *
 * NOW MEASURED, so it is forced. Across three successful dispenses the line
 * idled HIGH every time and a pill pulled it LOW. Boot-time sampling remained
 * unreliable even after the settle logic — one boot read the line LOW for its
 * whole two-second trace and the per-dispense re-learn corrected it to HIGH —
 * which is the module needing longer than a boot to stabilise. There is no
 * reason to keep inferring a value we have now observed seven times. */

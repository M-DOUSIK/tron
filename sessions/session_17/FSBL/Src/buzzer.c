/* buzzer.c — active piezo buzzer on PA3, driven by the Alert task
 *
 * PIN. Arduino D10 / PA3, main VDD I/O domain, plain push-pull output.
 * Reserved for this before the dispenser driver was written precisely so it
 * could not be taken later — session_17.md Part E is explicit that a buzzer
 * which stole a pin from the dispenser would be a worse outcome than no
 * buzzer. PA3's alternate function is TIM16_CH1, which a passive buzzer
 * would have needed; an active one does not, so TIM16 is left free.
 *
 * NO TRANSISTOR. The part is an active PIEZO buzzer — a few milliamps at
 * 3.3 V — which a GPIO sources comfortably. A MAGNETIC active buzzer draws
 * 25-35 mA and would need an NPN and a flyback diode; this is not one.
 *
 * NO DMA, NO TIMER, so session_12_notes.md Addendum 9 does not apply:
 * ms_configure_sleep_clocks() needs no new LPEN bit for this module. The
 * tone is a GPIO held high by a task that sleeps between edges, and the
 * task's own osal_delay_ms() is what keeps the kernel tick running.

 * The patterns
 *
 * Each is a NUL-terminated list of durations in milliseconds, alternating
 * ON, OFF, ON, OFF... A trailing OFF is harmless and keeps repeats separated.
 *
 * Rhythm carries the meaning because an active buzzer has one pitch:
 *
 *   TICK           a single 10 ms blip. Deliberately below what reads as a
 *                  "beep" — it should feel like a key travelling, not an
 *                  alert. Anything longer becomes irritating at speed.
 *   DISPENSE_OK    two quick beeps: something finished, successfully.
 *   DISPENSE_FAIL  four rapid beeps: the universal "that did not work".
 *   DOSE_REMINDER  three polite double-pulses, patient-facing. Short tones,
 *                  so it asks rather than demands.
 *   DOSE_MISSED    four LONG pulses, twice. The only pattern built from long
 *                  tones, because it is the only one that has to carry to a
 *                  carer in another room. Nothing else sounds like it.

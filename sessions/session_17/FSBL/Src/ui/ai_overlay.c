 * window that is an ANAMORPHIC squash - 800 across compressed to 300 while
 * 480 down went to the same 300 - so the same face looked narrower here than
 * on the capture screens, from a wider field of view, at half the vertical
 * resolution because of PV_ROW_STEP. Three differences at once, which is why
 * it read as "not sure if it's the border or the shape or the resolution":
 * it was all of them.
 *
 * Sharing the crop means the three camera views are the same picture of the
 * same thing at three moments, which is the whole point of the shared
 * layout. It also matches what the models are given - ai_vision.c crops the
 * centred square for the detector, and the intake ROI is a window inside

 * These two constants exist for one reason: PSRAM read bandwidth. Each
 * repaint copies source rows out of the camera frame at 0x90400000, which is
 * THROUGHPUT=MID LATENCY=HIGH, and at 252 rows x 1600 bytes that is 403 KB per
 * repaint. At the first setting (150 ms, every row) that came to ~2.7 MB/s of
 * PSRAM traffic sustained for the whole watch, and the measured cost was
 * plain: idle fell to 40% during an intake watch against 88% either side of
 * it. The overlay is a demonstration feature; it is not allowed to cost a
 * third of the power budget this project reports.
 *
 *   PV_ROW_STEP 2 reads every second pane row and writes it twice. Halves the
 *   PSRAM traffic. On a 252 px pane fed from a 480 px source the vertical
 *   sampling goes from 1:1.9 to 1:3.8, which on a 336x252 preview of a face is
 *   not a difference a viewer notices.
 *
 *   PV_PERIOD_MS 250 gives 4 Hz. Still unmistakably live — the box tracks a
 *   hand moving toward a mouth — at 60% of the repaint rate.
 *
 * Together: ~0.8 MB/s, a third of what it was. */

 * so at the instant a capture completes the framebuffer literally CONTAINS
 * NPU TENSORS. Unblanking the display at that moment shows them.
 *
 * So this function does not overlay anything. It OWNS the screen: full
 * repaint, product chrome, one large centred image, a title and a caption.
 * The rule is simple and worth stating because it was violated once already -

     *
     *  1. It sampled PSRAM pixel by pixel with a nearest-neighbour stride.
     *     PSRAM is THROUGHPUT=MID LATENCY=HIGH (MEMORY_MAP.md §1b); scattered
     *     single-halfword reads are close to the worst thing you can do to it.
     *     Now each source row is copied ONCE, sequentially, into a small
     *     line buffer, and the subsampling happens in fast internal RAM.
     *
     *  2. It called gui_draw_rect() once per pixel - 54,000 function calls
     *     with bounds checks, to place single pixels. Now it writes the
     *     framebuffer directly through one pointer.

/* ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * THE LIVE FACE PREVIEW
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * Until now the seconds before a face capture were a RAW CAMERA DUMP: the
 * DCMIPP wrote all 800x480 of the framebuffer continuously, so no chrome, no
 * title and no text could survive a single frame. The device went from a
 * designed screen to an undesigned one and back, and nothing could be said to
 * the user in between - which is exactly the moment they most need telling
 * what to do.
 *
 * The fix is the trick Session 16 already proved for the intake watch: point
 * the camera at PSRAM instead of at the screen. The UI then owns
 * BUFFER_ADDRESS outright and can draw a real screen - frame chrome, a
 * greeting that uses the patient's name, a rounded viewport - and blit the
 * live image INTO the viewport as one element of a composed page.
 *
 * -- WHAT THE VIEWPORT SHOWS, AND WHY IT IS SQUARE ------------------------
 *
 * ai_vision_run_pipeline() does not analyse the whole frame. It crops the
 * centred CROP_SIZE x CROP_SIZE square out of BUFFER_ADDRESS and hands the
 * detector that. So the viewport deliberately shows THAT SQUARE and nothing
 * else: what the user sees framed is precisely what the model will be given.
 * A wide preview would let someone centre themselves perfectly in a picture
 * whose edges the NPU never receives.
 *
 * -- THE HANDOVER BACK, WHICH IS THE ONE FRAGILE PART ---------------------
 *
 * The capture reads BUFFER_ADDRESS. While the preview runs, the camera is
 * NOT writing there. So preview_end() must repoint the pipe and then the
 * caller must let at least one whole frame land before requesting a capture,
 * or the NPU is handed the stale contents of a screen. That settle window is
 * PREVIEW_SETTLE_MS in state_machine.c, and it is not optional.

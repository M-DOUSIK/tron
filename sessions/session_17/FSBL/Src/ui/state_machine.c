/* state_machine.c — MedSight application state machine
 *
 * Session 07 changes:
 *  - HAL_Delay() replaced with osal_delay_ms() (yields CPU instead of busy-wait)
 *  - SD log calls use SD_Log_Event_Async() (non-blocking, queue-backed)
 *  - HAL_GetTick() kept as-is (works under FreeRTOS via vApplicationTickHook)
 *
 * Session 09B changes:
 *  - STATE_CAMERA_DISPENSE now runs the real face-detect + embed + gallery
 *    match pipeline (ai_vision.c) instead of a mock timer.
 *  - STATE_CAMERA_REGISTER is still a mock timer — real enrollment is
 *    Session 09's job, not this session's.
 *
 * Session 09 changes:
 *  - STATE_CAMERA_REGISTER now runs the real face-detect + embed pipeline
 *    (mirroring STATE_CAMERA_DISPENSE's proven camera_stop()/camera_start()
 *    + 3-retry pattern), then hands off to three new states —
 *    STATE_KEYBOARD_REGISTER, STATE_PILLCOUNT_REGISTER,
 *    STATE_CONFIRM_REGISTER — owned by registration_ui.c, which collect a
 *    name and daily pill count and call gallery_add_patient() on confirm.
 * Session 11 will wire the mascot state (MASCOT_SUCCESS/MASCOT_ERROR) and
 * full dispense-flow orchestration on top of this identification result.
 *
 * Session 12 changes:
 *  - The two face-capture states no longer BLOCK inside the AI pipeline.
 *    ai_vision_run_pipeline() used to be called straight from here, so the
 *    UI task sat inside the NPU for up to several seconds per capture with
 *    touch unpolled and the physical USER1 button dead. Inference now runs
 *    in its own µT-Kernel task (ai_vision.c, priority 3, below this task) and
 *    both capture states became small non-blocking phase machines built from
 *    the same "decide once, then poll HAL_GetTick()" pattern this file
 *    already uses everywhere else. Behaviour is unchanged — same 1.5 s
 *    preview window, same 3 attempts 500 ms apart, same camera_stop()
 *    sequencing — only who executes it and how this task waits.
 *  - FRAME-BUFFER OWNERSHIP. Between ai_vision_capture_request() and the
 *    matching ai_vision_capture_wait() success, the AI task owns
 *    BUFFER_ADDRESS: both NPU networks' activation scratch overlaps it (see
 *    the memory-hazard note at the top of ai_vision.c). This file must draw
 *    nothing at all across that window — which is why a USER1 press during a
 *    capture is recorded as s_cancel_pending and acted on only once the
 *    capture completes, instead of transitioning home and redrawing straight
 *    into memory the NPU is still using.
 *  - Hardening: gallery-full is refused up front, three failed capture
 *    attempts offer TRY AGAIN / CANCEL instead of dead-ending home, and an
 *    unavailable SD card is stated on the home screen instead of failing
 *    silently.
 *  - pill_count is the DOSE, not a stock level. The `pills_remaining`
 *    decrement-and-resave on every confirmed dose is gone, along with the
 *    "refill needed" alerts that were built on top of it — see ai_vision.h.

 * Session 15, B3 — the scheduled-dose engine
 *
 * The Program Plan submitted in March named "Schedule validation" as a core
 * function and described the camera task waking "on a scheduled uT-Kernel
 * alarm (aligned to dose times)". Nothing in this device has ever known the
 * time of day. This is that, built.
 *
 * ── Why an alarm handler and not a polling task ──────────────────────────
 *
 * A dose window is a one-shot deadline at an absolute time of day, three or
 * four times a day. A task that woke every ten seconds to compare the clock
 * against a schedule would wake 8,640 times a day in order to act four
 * times, and it would do that against the one number this project has been
 * measuring since Session 12 — the ~89% of wall-clock time the Cortex-M55
 * spends asleep. uT-Kernel's tk_cre_alm/tk_sta_alm is an object that costs
 * exactly nothing until it fires. Rule 1.4's "real-time performance" and its
 * "power saving" are answered here by the same mechanism.
 *
 * ── The two edges, and why one alarm serves both ─────────────────────────
 *
 * A dose window has an opening and a closing edge, and both matter:
 *   OPEN    the window starts  -> remind, and start counting
 *   CLOSE   the window ends    -> if nobody dispensed, this is a MISSED dose
 * The missed-dose line is the single most valuable entry in the whole audit
 * trail and this device has never been able to write it. So the alarm is
 * re-armed for the close the moment it fires for the open, and re-armed for
 * the next dose the moment it fires for the close. One object, one pending
 * expiry at a time, and no polling anywhere.
 *
 * ── Handler context ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * schedule_alarm_handler() runs in uT-Kernel's timer context. It may not
 * block, may not printf, may not call anything unbounded — see ms_osal.h's
 * warning, and session_11_notes.md Addendum 8 for what a slow handler path
 * costs on this hardware. It sets one bit in an event flag and returns. The
 * UI task does every piece of actual work: reading the gallery, drawing,
 * logging. That is the same division of labour Session 12 established for
 * the AI task, applied to time instead of to inference.
 * ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ */

/* ── Session 13, Part A: the second framebuffer does not exist ────────────
 *
 * GUI_BUFFER_ADDRESS (0x342BB800) was going to be a second framebuffer so
 * the UI could keep drawing while the NPU ran. A canary check written for
 * exactly this question answered it on hardware, on the first capture:
 *
 *   CANARY FAIL: GUI_BUFFER_ADDRESS (0x342BB800-0x34376FFF) was overwritten
 *   during capture (first=3B185504 last=3E2699ED, expected C0FFEEA5)
 *
 * Both ends of the 750 KB region were clobbered, with what are plainly
 * float bit patterns — NPU activation data. So the activation scratch does
 * not merely start at BUFFER_ADDRESS, it runs past the whole of the second
 * framebuffer: at least 0x34200000-0x34376FFF, over 1.5 MB.
 *
 * prompts/session_13.md was explicit about this case: "If it does not fit,
 * say so and stop — do not shrink the framebuffer or move the NPU's pools
 * to make it fit." So this file is back to Session 12's single-buffer
 * behaviour, and the capture window is handled by blanking the display
 * instead (see display_blank()). See session_13_notes.md Addendum 2.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */

/* Blank the panel while the NPU owns BUFFER_ADDRESS, rather than leaving a
 * frozen camera frame on screen to be visibly scribbled over for ~750 ms.
 * Disabling the layer makes the LTDC show its background colour (set to the
 * theme blush in main.c's LCD_Init), which reads as an intentional pause.
 *
 * Gated so it can be turned off without unpicking anything if it ever
 * misbehaves on hardware: set to 0 and the old Session 12 behaviour (a
 * corrupting frozen frame) comes back. */

     * are rewritten on every stai_pill_run(). But "harmless because of a flag

     * should not be run over memory that is now SPOKEN FOR.

# NPU weights — what to flash, where, and why the firmware is useless without it

Everything in this directory is **NPU model data that the firmware build does
not contain**. The linker marks the external NOR regions `(NOLOAD)` on purpose,
so building and flashing the application never writes any of it.

That means a fresh clone can compile a perfectly good `.elf`, flash it, and get
a device whose face recognition and action recognition both produce garbage —
with nothing in any log to say why. **Flash these once per board.**

## The five images

| file | address | bytes | what it is |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fd_data.xSPI2.bin` | `0x70380000` | 2,030,881 | CenterFace — face detector constant pools |
| `ec_blobs.xSPI2.bin` | `0x71000000` | 296,832 | NPU epoch-controller microcode, **both** face networks |
| `faceid_data.xSPI2.bin` | `0x72000000` | 1,092,129 | MobileFaceNet — face embedder constant pools |
| `hand_atonbuf.xSPI2.bin` | `0x73000000` | 3,221,233 | MediaPipe hand landmarks — Session 16, decides a dose |
| `pill_atonbuf.xSPI2.bin` | `0x73400000` | 3,049,169 | YOLOv8n pill detector — Session 16, corroboration only |

SHA-256 prefixes, so a mis-copied file is caught before it becomes a debugging
session:

## Flashing

```powershell
$cli    = "C:\ST\STM32CubeIDE_2.1.1\STM32CubeIDE\plugins\com.st.stm32cube.ide.mcu.externaltools.cubeprogrammer.win32_2.2.500.202603051304\tools\bin\STM32_Programmer_CLI.exe"
$loader = "C:\ST\STM32CubeIDE_2.1.1\STM32CubeIDE\plugins\com.st.stm32cube.ide.mcu.externaltools.cubeprogrammer.win32_2.2.500.202603051304\tools\bin\ExternalLoader\MX66UW1G45G_STM32N6570-DK.stldr"

& $cli -c port=SWD mode=UR -el $loader -w "weights\fd_data.xSPI2.bin"        0x70380000
& $cli -c port=SWD mode=UR -el $loader -w "weights\ec_blobs.xSPI2.bin"       0x71000000
& $cli -c port=SWD mode=UR -el $loader -w "weights\faceid_data.xSPI2.bin"    0x72000000
& $cli -c port=SWD mode=UR -el $loader -w "weights\hand_atonbuf.xSPI2.bin"   0x73000000
& $cli -c port=SWD mode=UR -el $loader -w "weights\pill_atonbuf.xSPI2.bin"   0x73400000
```

### `mode=UR`, not `mode=HOTPLUG` — corrected in Session 17

This page said `mode=HOTPLUG` for two years, and it was right for two years:
the only writes happened before any application existed on the board, and
HOTPLUG avoids holding the MCU in reset while the external loader talks to the
flash chip.

Session 17 put a bootable MedSight image in external flash, and that changed
the situation. HOTPLUG needs a live, responsive core to attach to — and with
MedSight **running**, the erase fails outright, because the application has
XSPI2 memory-mapped for these very weights while the loader wants the same bus
in indirect mode.

**Use `mode=UR` for writes to external flash.** It holds the target in reset,
so it does not care what the application was doing. The commands above have
been updated.

### Then POWER-CYCLE. Unplug the USB cable.

Not a reset, not the IDE's stop button — the cable, out, for a few seconds.

Back-to-back external-loader operations leave the flash chip's live bus state
confused, and the symptom is a boot that hangs where XSPI is first touched:
the log stops right after `ai_vision_init: DEBUG build (-O0).`, before
`HAL_CACHEAXI_Enable`, and the LCD holds a stale frame. The flash *contents*
are fine; only the peripheral's bus state needs clearing.

**This applies to reads as well as writes.** It was originally documented for
flashing only, and it bit us a second time in Session 16 after two `-r32`
verification reads — which is exactly when you are most tempted to leave the
board running.

### Verifying

```powershell
& $cli -c port=SWD mode=UR -el $loader -r32 0x73000000 2
```

Compare against the file's own first words, then power-cycle again:

```bash
python -c "import struct;print('0x%08X 0x%08X' % struct.unpack('<II', open('weights/hand_atonbuf.xSPI2.bin','rb').read(8)))"
```

`0x73000000` should read `0xB317E9A4`, `0x73400000` should read `0xF0010DF7`.

## Confirming it worked

A correct boot says, in this order:

```
ai_vision_init: face detector + embedder ready.
ARENA SELFTEST PASS: 225280 bytes writable and readable
intake: hand landmark model ready (MediaPipe 224x224 INT8, 21 keypoints, ...)
intake: pill detector ready (YOLOv8n 160x160 INT8, head cut, decode on CPU).
```

A missing or wrong image usually does **not** announce itself as a flash
error — it shows up as a network that initialises and then returns nonsense.
If detection runs but the numbers are meaningless, suspect a weight region
before suspecting the code.

## Where these come from

* **`fd_data`, `faceid_data`, `ec_blobs`** — generated in Session 08B and
  unchanged since. Byte-identical across every session from 08B to 13, which is
  how the copies here were validated. The epoch-controller data's source of
  truth is the tracked headers `FSBL/Inc/fd_ecblobs.h`, `faceid_ecblobs.h` and
  `network_ecblobs.h`; `ec_blobs.xSPI2.bin` is a packaging of the same content
  for the programmer.
* **`hand_atonbuf`** — ST model zoo `pose_estimation/handlandmarks`,
  Apache-2.0, regenerated in Session 16 against `medsight_hand.mpool`.
* **`pill_atonbuf`** — the hard-negative retrain, regenerated against
  `medsight_pill2.mpool` so it does not collide with the hand model.

Regenerating either Session 16 model is in `documents/AI_LESSONS.md` §2c. Note
that a regenerated model changes its INT8 quantisation scales, which live in
`Inc/stai_*.h` — **so a weights change always requires a firmware rebuild**,
even though the firmware does not contain the weights.

## Why this directory exists at all

These blobs used to live only inside `sessions/*/STM32CubeIDE/FSBL/Debug/
weights_flash/`, i.e. inside build output. When Session 16 stopped tracking
build output, that silently removed the only copies of the face-network weights
from the repository — the check that authorised the removal looked for
hand-written source and found none, which was the wrong question. Not
hand-written is not the same as regenerable, and for the face networks there is
no regeneration path in this repository at all.

Irreplaceable binary assets do not belong in a directory that a `.gitignore`
rule can sweep away.
